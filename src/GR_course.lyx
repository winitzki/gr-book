\begin_layout Standard
This book is a revised and extended version of lecture notes for the course
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Topics in Advanced General Relativity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 taught by the author in the fall semester of 2005/06 at Ludwig-Maximilians
 University, Munich.
 The audience included advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students.
 The choice of topics is intended to complement an introductory course in
 general relativity, which is assumed as a prerequisite.
 The present text covers differential geometry on manifolds, asymptotically
 flat spacetimes, singularity theorems, the use of variational principles
 in GR, the vielbein formalism, and spinor calculus.
 My goal is to provide a readable introduction to concepts that are covered
 in existing advanced texts, such as the classic books\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{HaEl73}

\end_inset

 and\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Wald84}

\end_inset

, and also explain a small number of newer results that are sufficiently
 tightly connected with the main topics of the lectures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This book is intended a textbook rather than a research monograph.
 I give no overview of the history of the subject, and I do not intend to
 give complete references to first publications.
 I feel that this approach is justified because all the material (with a
 small number of exceptions) is well-established, and people who developed
 this subject already received the credit due to them.
 The scarcity of research-level references is also compensated by the fact
 that I derive all results in a self-contained fashion, unstead of referring
 readers to derivations in the literature.
 The bibliography contains
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
\emph on

\emph default

\end_layout

\end_inset

 all the sources I consulted while preparing this book.
 After digesting the main ideas explained here, readers will be able to
 understand research-level papers and monographs listed in the bibliography.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I would like to make some comments regarding the organization of the text.
 I emphasize visual and conceptual explanations; however, I derive all the
 principal results in full detail.
 Definitions of useful mathematical notions are motivated and illustrated
 by examples.
 New terminology is shown in 
\series bold
boldface
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{boldface}

\end_inset


\series default
 within or near a definition; the 
\emph on
italics
\emph default
 type is reserved for emphasis.
 The symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $\blacksquare$
\end_inset

 marks the end of a derivation, a remark, or an example.
 These marks are intended to aid the reader in skipping unwanted material.
 Subsections marked with asterisks* may also be skipped at first reading.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The exposition in a previous version of this text was interspersed with
 unproved statements labeled 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

exercises
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

problems
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that provided important additional information or even constituted an integral
 part of the development of the material.
 I call such statements 
\series bold
pseudo-exercises
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{pseudo-exercises}

\end_inset


\series default
 since they are usually not as straightforward as genuine practice problems
 would be.
 It seems to me that the main reason for the existence of pseudo-exercises
 was my desire to avoid cluttering the text with derivations that may be
 omitted during a first reading.
 I feel that readers at an advanced level are insufficiently motivated and/or
 lack the time needed to solve pseudo-exercises.
 So I decided that this book will not contain any pseudo-exercises; every
 relevant statement
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Standard
An 
\series bold
irrelevant statement
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{irrelevant statement}

\end_inset


\series default
 is something that seems generally interesting but has no direct relevance
 to the main subjects of the book.
 For example, the statement 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bianchi identities can be generalized to connections with nonzero torsion,
 see Ref.\InsetSpace ~
[xyz]
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is irrelevant here because I 
\emph on
never
\emph default
 consider such connections in this book.
 Irrelevant statements, sometimes accompanied by references to additional
 literature, are confined to footnotes.
 The reader may safely ignore all the footnotes.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 comes with a derivation.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
At present, some pseudo-exercises still remain, but almost all of them (except
 a very few) have full solutions.
 Pseudo-exercises are gradually converted to statements as the current major
 revision of the book progresses.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The readers are certainly free to skip derivations that are not interesting
 to them.
 Many derivations and calculations are relegated to Appendix\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cha:Calculations}

\end_inset

 to make the main text shorter.
 I also included a small number of short
\series bold
 Practice problems

 (Solutions to those are not given.)

\begin_layout Standard
A comment on the status of this text is in order.
 The book is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

complete
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the sense that there are no gaps in the calculations.
 However, the text is presently being heavily revised.
 This preliminary version is now made freely available because I feel that
 it is useful even in the present, unfinished state.
 (Warning: the present text is a draft and 
\emph on
may
\emph default
 contain mistakes! If you 
\emph on
must
\emph default
 have a set of lecture notes in a finished form, please do not read this
 text until it is marked as a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 version.
 For example, it is presently not clear which sign convention for the Ricci
 tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 I will finally adopt; because of this, signs might be inconsistent in some
 equations involving 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

.
 Some comments regarding possible improvements are scattered in boldface
 throughout the text.
 These will disappear after the revision.)

General comments: The text is too wordy and verbose.
 It should also be more high-level.
 Remove solutions of simpler problems; show the sign conventions for R and
 g more clearly (and figure out what's wrong with Ludvigsen's sign convention!)
 Give short formulations of everything and short derivations; refer to longer
 derivations or comments in another section; make hyperlinks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also: lots of calculations with Riemann tensor involving [a,b] whereas a
 choice of a,b such that [a,b]=0 will greatly simplify matters.
 Show this using an example, showing both calculations.
 Comment that this is similar to the index notation calculations where coordinat
es always commute.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also: Need to separate the really important statements from those that aren't
 used elsewhere in the book.
 Such things are also interesting (since I spent time figuring them out
 and they weren't clear in textbooks) but they should be clearly separated
 from the core material.

Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
General Relativity (
\series bold
GR
\series default
) is a currently well-established physical theory of gravitation whose mathemati
cal apparatus is based on differential geometry (more specifically, tensor
 calculus in curved spaces).
 In this chapter, I introduce the main concepts of this calculus: manifolds,
 tangent spaces, covariant derivatives, and curvature.
 I will explain and use the index-free notation.
 You (the reader) will perhaps appreciate this material more fully if you
 are already somewhat familiar with tensor calculus and GR, at least to
 the extent covered in Appendix\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cha:Elements-of-Special}

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The pragmatic side of this chapter is to develop sufficiently powerful formalism
 for index-free calculations, which will be heavily used throughout this
 book.

Index-free notation

\begin_layout Standard
One approach to differential geometry is to treat vectors and tensors as
 multi-indexed arrays of numbers (called 
\series bold
components
\series default
)
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{components}

\end_inset

, such as 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $R^{\lambda}{}_{\mu\alpha\beta}$
\end_inset

, which depend on the choice of the coordinate system 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x^{\mu}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 One manipulates expressions with many indices and implicit summations over
 indices, such as 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{\mu\alpha}g_{\lambda\mu,\nu}g^{\nu\beta}$
\end_inset

, and checks at the end of the calculations that the results are 
\series bold
covariant

 (i.e.\InsetSpace ~
transform correctly under changes of coordinates).
 This approach was pioneered by Einstein and is still the way tensor calculus
 is presented in the current physical literature.
 I assume that you were already exposed to an introductory course of GR
 formulated using coordinates and components.
 If you are not sure, please scan Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_layout Standard
In the mathematical literature, the coordinate-free approach and the 
\series bold

\series default

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{index-free notation}

\end_inset

 are predominant.
 For example, the scalar product of vectors is denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})$
\end_inset

 or just 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}a^{\mu}b^{\nu}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{\mu}b^{\mu}$
\end_inset

.
 The preference for the coordinate-free approach is, in my opinion, due
 to the different character of the tasks typically undertaken by mathematicians
 and by physicists.
 Mathematicians study abstract relationships between objects and are more
 interested in finding objects that have rich properties and whose interconnecti
ons explain earlier results on a more general level and yield new concepts.
 On the other hand, physicists are mostly interested in making specific
 computations and deriving equations that will eventually give numerical
 values for quantities, even if the methods of computation are not particularly
 general, elegant, or illuminating.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the coordinate-free approach, one avoids introducing a particular coordinate
 system 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x^{\mu}\right\} $
\end_inset

, and one does not talk about components of tensors.
 Instead, one uses geometrically defined operations, such as the covariant
 derivative or the Lie derivative, and the algebraic properties of tensors.
 In a calculation where a particular tensor is sought, especially when no
 symmetries are present, it may be helpful to introduce a suitable coordinate
 system and to determine the components of that tensor.
 However, often one needs to perform a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

general
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 calculation that does not depend on a particular tensor (e.g., an investigation
 of a general property of the curvature tensor).
 In most cases, such 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

general
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 calculations are easier to perform in the coordinate-free approach because
 coordinate systems and components offer no computational or conceptual
 advantages.
 The experience of writing this book shows that the coordinate-free approach
 is well suited for applications such as studying the singularity theorems
 or the Hamiltonian formulation of GR.

Although, strictly speaking, not necessary.
 Instead, one could use Penrose's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

abstract index notation,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $a^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 means a vector with an abstract label 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

, rather than an array of components.
 See Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Abstract-index-notation}

\end_inset

 for more details.
 One book that consistently uses the coordinate-free approach together with
 the abstract index notation is\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Ludv99}

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 to use the index-free notation when one adopts the coordinate-free approach.
 Here is an example of a calculation in the index-free notation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Statement
\emph default
: If a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 is geodesic then 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{u})$
\end_inset

 is constant along the orbits of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

.
 
\emph on
Proof
\emph default
: The derivative of 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{u})$
\end_inset

 along the flow of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{u}}g(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{u})=\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}g(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{u})=2g(\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{u},\mathbf{u})=0\]

\end_inset

since 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{u}=0$
\end_inset

 for geodesic vector fields.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For comparison, the same calculation in the index notation looks like this:
 assuming that 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{\lambda}u^{\mu}{}_{;\lambda}=0$
\end_inset

, we have
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{d}{d\tau}\left(g_{\mu\nu}u^{\mu}u^{\nu}\right)=u^{\lambda}\left(g_{\mu\nu}u^{\mu}u^{\nu}\right)_{;\lambda}=2g_{\mu\nu}u^{\lambda}u^{\mu}{}_{;\lambda}u^{\nu}=0.\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The index notation is frequently very useful and even unavoidable in some
 calculations, especially when one needs to manipulate traces of high-rank
 tensors, as if often the case in GR.
 Nevertheless, the index-free notation has, in my view, significant advantages
 in the study of more mathematically advanced topics of field theory and
 GR.
 The index-free notation is concise, emphasizes the geometrical meaning
 of every quantity, and completely excludes non-tensorial quantities from
 consideration; for instance, the non-tensorial Christoffel symbols cannot
 even be defined.
 The index-free approach is well-suited for studying the general properties
 of various geometrical objects used in GR.
 Many general derivations (such as computing the second variation of the
 geodesic length) can be performed faster and more transparently in the
 index-free notation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this text, I adopt the coordinate-free approach; this leaves the choice
 of an index-free notation or the abstract index notation.
 I employ index-free calculations when it is practically more convenient
 than the abstract index notation.
 The index-free approach turns out to be almost always more convenient,
 except for certain cases, such as the variation of the Einstein-Hilbert
 action with respect to the metric, where index-free calculations become
 cumbersome (although still possible).
 In those cases I use the abstract index notation.
 Section\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:Calculations-in-index-free}

\end_inset

 presents more discussion and shows how to convert expressions between the
 index-free and the index notations.
 In this book, I also introduce an admittedly nonstandard but unambiguous
 and adequate index-free notation for the trace of a tensor (Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Index-free-trace}

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To make the transition to the index-free approach easier for readers accustomed
 to the index notation, I will sometimes mention the index representation
 of tensor quantities used throughout the text.
 The formal correspondence between the index-free and the index notations
 is summarized in the following table.

\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}$

 in differentials (for instance, writing 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}^{2}x(\tau)/\textrm{d}\tau^{2}$

\begin_inset Formula $\int\textrm{d}^{3}x$

\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 as was the common practice during the previous two centuries.
 I decided to use the roman symbol 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd

 to denote the exterior differential in the calculus of differential forms,
 but continue to use the italic 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in other situations when differential forms are not involved.
 My intention is to use a roman 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for rigorously defined objects, such as differential forms 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}x$
\end_inset

, and to contrast them with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

infinitesimals
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $dx$
\end_inset

, which are only heuristic notational tools that help the intuition.
 I write integrals, e.g.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset Formula $\int\textrm{d}^{3}x$
\end_inset

, with a roman 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 when the integration of a differential form is implied, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}^{3}x$
\end_inset

 is a shorthand notation for the 3-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}x\wedge\textrm{d}y\wedge\textrm{d}z$
\end_inset

.
 However, I write an italic 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in derivatives, 
\begin_inset Formula $d/dt$
\end_inset

, and in integrals such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\int f(x)dx$
\end_inset

 where I need a simple one-dimensional integration rather than an integration
 of 1-form over a contour.
 I also write the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

metric interval,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula \[
ds^{2}=dt^{2}-dx^{2}-dy^{2}-dz^{2},\]

\end_inset

with an italic 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 because this notation is essentially a jargon that bears only marginally
 on the calculus of differential forms; for instance, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $ds$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cannot be understood as a 1-form in this notation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When using ordinary derivatives, I write 
\begin_inset Formula $d/d\tau$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $d^{2}/d\tau^{2}$
\end_inset

 using the italic 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, for the following reasons.
 The operators 
\begin_inset Formula $d/d\tau$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $d^{2}/d\tau^{2}$
\end_inset

 are not essentially different from the partial derivative operators 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial/\partial x$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial^{2}/\partial x^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Traditionally, one writes 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial f/\partial x$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 depends not only on 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 but also on other variables 
\begin_inset Formula $y,z,...$
\end_inset

 that are held constant while 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x,y,z,...)$
\end_inset

 is differentiated with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 On the other hand, one writes 
\begin_inset Formula $df/dx$
\end_inset

 to emphasize that 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 is a function of only one variable 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, or that 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is an expression that must be reduced, through suitable substitutions,
 to a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 only.
 This notation is widely used to avoid cluttering the equations with explicit
 substitutions.
 For instance, the Euler-Lagrange equation of mechanics is written as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{\partial L}{\partial x}-\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial\dot{x}}=0,\]

\end_inset

implying that 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial L/\partial\dot{x}$
\end_inset

 must be expressed as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 before evaluating 
\begin_inset Formula $d/dt$
\end_inset

.
 However, the 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

's in the differential operators 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial/\partial x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $d/dx$
\end_inset

 are merely historically developed notation and are not directly related
 to the exterior differential 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}$
\end_inset

.
 I use an italic

\begin_inset Formula $d$

 In this book, my principal intention is to make the notation unambiguous
 for a student who initially does not feel sure in this subject, while not
 excessively cluttering the writing.
 I use a roman 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\text{i}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for the imaginary unit because the letter 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 is frequently used as an index, e.g.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 However, I use an italic 
\begin_inset Formula $e=2.718...$
\end_inset

 to avoid confusion with a boldface roman 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}$
\end_inset

 frequently used for frame basis vectors,

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

 In other words, every point 
\begin_inset Formula $p\in\mathcal{M}$

 has a small neighborhood around it, which is one-to-one mapped into a subset
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{n}$

 This mapping is called a

\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{U}(p_{0})$

\begin_inset Formula $x^{\mu}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

 corresponding to points 
\begin_inset Formula $p\in\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 These functions must uniquely identify each point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$

\begin_inset Formula $p,p'$

 from the neighborhood 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{U}(p_{0})$

 we have 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\mu}(p)=x^{\mu}(p')$

 Also, the image of the neighborhood 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{U}(p_{0})$
\end_inset

 under the map 
\begin_inset Formula $p\mapsto x^{\mu}(p)\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

 must be an open set in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{n}$

A typical example of a manifold is the surface of a sphere in 3-dimensional

 The 2-sphere

 It is useful to visualize a manifold as a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

surface
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 embedded in a larger space, and to think that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

we
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

flat
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 So 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

we

\begin_layout Standard
As an example of a manifold described in a different way, consider the set
 of all 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times2$

 unitary complex matrices with unit determinant.
 These matrices form a group denoted 
\begin_inset Formula $SU(2)$
\end_inset

 (A matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

 is 
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula $A^{\dagger}A=1$

\begin_inset Formula $A^{\dagger}$

 is the Hermitian conjugate, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
the transposed and complex conjugate matrix.)
 It is perhaps not immediately clear how to introduce coordinates in this
 set of matrices.
 It can be shown (see Statement
\begin_inset LatexCommand \vref{par:Exercise:SU2 quaternions}

\end_inset

) that all matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $A\in SU(2)$
\end_inset

 can be described explicitly as
\begin_inset Formula \[
A=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
a_{0}-\text{i}a_{3} & -\text{i}a_{1}-a_{2}\\
-\text{i}a_{1}+a_{2} & a_{0}+\text{i}a_{3}\end{array}\right),\]

where 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{0}$

, ..., 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{3}$
\end_inset

 are real numbers satisfying 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{j=0}^{3}a_{j}^{2}=1$
\end_inset

 Vectors from the tangent space are denoted by boldface letters, e.g.\InsetSpace ~

 Using a local coordinate system 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x^{\alpha}\right\} $

\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=1,...,n$

\begin_inset Formula $v^{\alpha}=\mathbf{v}\circ x^{\alpha}$

 This is so because every chart will map a patch of

One of the main assumptions underlying GR is that the geometry of our universe

 In a curved geometry, initially parallel lines may move closer or further

 Let us examine the notion of

 Since the surface is smooth, every sufficiently small patch of the surface

\begin_layout Paragraph
Example: 2-sphere.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A typical example of a smooth manifold is the 
\series bold
unit 2-sphere
\series default
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{2-sphere}

\end_inset

specified by the equation
\begin_inset Formula \[
x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=1,\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 are the ordinary Cartesian coordinates in a three-dimensional Euclidean
 space.
 The 2-sphere is usually denoted 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 To establish that 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{2}$
\end_inset

 is a manifold, it is sufficient to find a local coordinate system near
 each point.
 This is straightforward; for instance, it is easy to see that the first
 two Cartesian coordinates, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x,y\right\} $
\end_inset

, can be used as local coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x_{1},x_{2}\right\} $
\end_inset

 in a neighborhood of the north pole 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,0,1\right\} $
\end_inset

, even in the entire northern hemisphere (but not beyond the equator).
 The coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x,y\right\} $
\end_inset

 cannot be used near the point 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x,y,z\right\} =\left\{ 0,1,0\right\} $
\end_inset

 because, e.g., a part of the straight line segment 
\begin_inset Formula $\{-1<x<1,\, y=0.99\}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{2}$
\end_inset

 that maps onto 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{2}$
\end_inset

 becomes a small circle in 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 So the coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x,y\right\} $
\end_inset

 do not provide a one-to-one map from any subset of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{2}$
\end_inset

 into 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{2}$
\end_inset

 near the point 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1,0\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 However, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x,z\right\} $
\end_inset

 can be used as a local coordinate system near 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1,0\right\} $
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An example of a non-manifold is a 2-sphere with a line attached to it.
 No two-dimensional local coordinate system can adequately represent the
 geometry in the neighborhood of the point where the line is attached.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Example: 2-Torus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another example of a two-dimensional manifold is a 2-torus.
 One way to describe the 2-torus is to specify it as the set of points 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x,y,z\right\} \in\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

 satisfying the equation (see Fig.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:2-torus}

\end_inset

) 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left(\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}-A\right)^{2}+z^{2}=R^{2},\quad A>R.\label{eq:torus embedding 1}\end{equation}

\end_inset

Another possibility is to describe the torus as a square with opposite sides
 identified.
 One can introduce local coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \phi,\theta\right\} $
\end_inset

 on the torus and the specify the embedding into 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\rho\cos\phi$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $y=\rho\sin\phi$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $z=R\cos\theta$
\end_inset

, where
\begin_inset Formula $\rho=A+R\sin\theta$
\end_inset

.
 Since this embedding is manifestly periodic in both 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 with period 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi$
\end_inset

, one needs to restrict the range of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 at most to 
\begin_inset Formula $0<\phi,\,\theta<2\pi$
\end_inset

 to satisfy the one-to-one mapping condition.
 Another choice of local coordinates is
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
x=\frac{a\cos\phi}{b-\sin\theta},\quad y=\frac{a\sin\phi}{b-\sin\theta},\quad z=c\frac{\cos\theta}{b-\sin\theta},\label{eq:torus embedding 2}\end{equation}

\end_inset

with appropriately chosen constants

 The main fact is that the intrinsic description is sufficient for all purposes

 must be independent of any such embedding.
 In any case, it turns out that the intrinsic description of the geometry

 Another argument in favor of the intrinsic description is that according

\end_inset

 such that the curve coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $X^{a}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 in the embedding space are smooth functions of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
 However, these definitions depend on the embedding of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 into 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{N}$
\end_inset

 This dependence can be avoided and equivalent definitions can be given
 
\emph on

, using local charts on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 that map patches of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 into patches of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Here is how one can define a smooth scalar function.
 Within one chart, a function 
\begin_inset Formula $f:\mathcal{M}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 becomes a function 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

, defined on a patch of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, smoothness of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 can be defined as smoothness of each restriction of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 to patches of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

.
 In brief, a function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is smooth in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 if it is smooth in every chart.
 Similarly, a curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 is smooth if its restriction 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

 to each chart is smooth.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we define smoothness of functions through their restrictions to charts,
 we need to consider what happens within an intersection of two different
 charts.
 Could it happen that a function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is smooth according to one chart but not smooth according to the other
 chart? Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{U}_{1},\mathcal{U}_{2}\subset\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 be two different chart domains and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{1}:\mathcal{U}_{1}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{2}:\mathcal{U}_{2}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

 the corresponding local coordinate maps.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{2}$
\end_inset

 are one-to-one maps, we may define a map 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{1}\phi_{2}^{-1}:\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

.
 (This map is defined in a small patch of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

 which is the image of the intersection of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{U}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{U}_{2}$
\end_inset

 under 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{2}$
\end_inset

.) We may call this map a 
\series bold
coordinate change
\series default
 
\series bold
map
\series default
.
 If 
\emph on
every
\emph default
 coordinate change map (for every pair of intersecting charts) is a smooth
 map 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

 in the usual sense, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
defined by smooth functions in the standard coordinates
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x_{1},...,x_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

, then all charts will agree about the smoothness or otherwise of a function
 
\begin_inset Formula $f:\mathcal{M}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 or a curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, one adds to the definition of a smooth manifold the requirement
 that every coordinate change map 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{1}\phi_{2}^{-1}$
\end_inset

 is smooth, for every pair of intersecting charts.
 In this way, smoothness of the manifold itself is adequately described
 by the requirement that the coordinate change maps be smooth.

 This tangent plane is a vector subspace of

 However, we cannot directly differentiate

For our present purposes, it is important to view the directional derivative

 The directional derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{D}_{\gamma}$

 at which the points 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)$

 For instance, the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{D}_{\gamma}f$

\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)$
\end_inset

 unchanged but replace the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $2\tau$

 Also, we note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{D}_{\gamma}f$
\end_inset

 depends on the behavior of the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 in an infinitesimal neighborhood of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$
\end_inset

 but does not depend on the behavior of 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$

 that yield the same derivative operation 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{D}_{\gamma}$
\end_inset

 at the point 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$

 Therefore, the operation 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{D}_{\gamma}$

 carries the information only about the magnitude and the direction of the

intantaneous velocity
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 This is precisely the information we expect to be represented by a tangent

 Thus we are motivated to view the

 A scalar function

 Then it is natural to consider the derivative of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$

 along the path of a moving particle.
 This directional derivative, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{D}_{\gamma}f$

 So the part of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{D}_{\gamma}f$
\end_inset

 that is independent of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$

the differential operator itself, is the object that carries information

 Hence, it is natural to identify the tangent vector as the differential

 is represented by the differential operator
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{D}_{\gamma}\equiv\sum_{\alpha}\left.\frac{d\gamma^{\alpha}}{d\tau}\right|_{\tau=0}\left.\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\alpha}}\right|_{p_{0}}\]

\end_inset

acting on functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial/\partial x^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 is the partial derivative with respect to one coordinate 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

.
 Moreover, we see that all the possible directional derivatives 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{D}_{\gamma}$
\end_inset

 are described by the set of coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ d\gamma^{\alpha}/d\tau\right\} $
\end_inset

 multiplying a fixed set of differential operators 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \partial/\partial x^{\alpha}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 The coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $d\gamma^{\alpha}/d\tau$
\end_inset

 depend on the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

, while the operators 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial/\partial x^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 do not.
 Therefore, it is natural to regard 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial/\partial x^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 as the basis in the vector space of directional derivatives and 
\begin_inset Formula $d\gamma^{\alpha}/d\tau$
\end_inset

 as the components of 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{D}_{\gamma}$
\end_inset

 in that basis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this way, we have expressed directional derivatives 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{D}_{\gamma}$
\end_inset

 at a point 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$
\end_inset

 as differential operators in a local coordinate system.
 An arbitrary directional derivative can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{\alpha}u^{\alpha}\partial/\partial x^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 are some coefficients.
 Now it is clear that all directional derivatives at point 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$
\end_inset

 form a vector space spanned by the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \partial/\partial x^{\alpha}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 This vector space is 
\emph on
the same
\emph default
 as the tangent space 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{p_{0}}\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 defined above using the embedding picture.
 This is so because the tangent space 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{p_{0}}\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 in the embedding picture consists of all the possible vectors tangent to
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$
\end_inset

, which is the same as the set of velocity vectors of all possible curves
 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$
\end_inset

, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
the set of all possible values of the components 
\begin_inset Formula $d\gamma^{\alpha}/d\tau$
\end_inset

.
 So we may 
\emph on
identify
\emph default
 the space of tangent vectors to curves at 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$
\end_inset

 with the space of directional derivatives at 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 These are two equivalent descriptions of the tangent space 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{p_{0}}\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

.
 A tangent vector can be understood both as a

 and, at the same time, as a differential operator acting on scalar functions.

\end_inset

This is a convenient way to compute the components of a vector in a coordinate

 or expressed in another way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a two-dimensional manifold with local coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x,y\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 Suppose that a curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)$
\end_inset

 is specified as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\gamma(\tau)=\left\{ x_{0}(\tau),y_{0}(\tau)\right\} =\left\{ \cos\tau,2\sin\tau\right\} \]

\end_inset

 in these coordinates.
 Let us compute the tangent vector to the curve, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}(\tau)\equiv\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}(\tau)$
\end_inset

.
 By definition, the tangent vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 acts on functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x,y)$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{v}\circ f\equiv\frac{d}{d\tau}f(x_{0}(\tau),y_{0}(\tau)).\]

\end_inset

The tangent vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{x}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{y}$
\end_inset

 are a basis in the tangent space at any point.
 The components of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 in the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \partial_{x},\partial_{y}\right\} $
\end_inset

 are found by using the coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 in the above equation.
 We find
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
v^{x} & =\mathbf{v}\circ x=\frac{d}{d\tau}x_{0}(\tau)=-\sin\tau,\\
v^{y} & =\mathbf{v}\circ y=\frac{d}{d\tau}y_{0}(\tau)=2\cos\tau.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}=-\left(\sin\tau\right)\partial_{x}+2\left(\cos\tau\right)\partial_{y}$
\end_inset

.
 By inspection, we can express 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 directly through 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{v}=-\frac{1}{2}y\partial_{x}+2x\partial_{y}.\]

\end_inset

Using this formula, we can define 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 as a vector 
\emph on
field
\emph default
 everywhere (not only on the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

).
 However, there are infinitely many different vector fields 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 that coincide with 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}$
\end_inset

 on the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

; the vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 shown above is just one such field that was, by a coincidence, easy to
 write down in the present case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us also compute the components of the vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 in a different coordinate system.
 For example, consider a new local coordinate system 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ a,b\right\} $
\end_inset

 defined by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
a=x+y,\quad b=e^{x-y}.\]

\end_inset

The inverse functions are
\begin_inset Formula \[
x=\frac{1}{2}\left(a+\ln b\right),\quad y=\frac{1}{2}\left(a-\ln b\right).\]

\end_inset

 The components of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 are found as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
v^{a} & =\mathbf{v}\circ a=\left(-\frac{1}{2}y\partial_{x}+2x\partial_{y}\right)\left(x+y\right)=-\frac{1}{2}y+2x,\\
v^{b} & =\mathbf{v}\circ b=\left(-\frac{1}{2}y\partial_{x}+2x\partial_{y}\right)e^{x-y}=\left(-\frac{1}{2}y-2x\right)e^{x-y}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Substituting 
\begin_inset Formula $x,y$
\end_inset

 through 
\begin_inset Formula $a,b$
\end_inset

, we can express the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 in the new coordinate system as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{v}=\left(\frac{3}{4}a+\frac{5}{4}\ln b\right)\partial_{a}+\left(-\frac{5}{4}a-\frac{3}{4}\ln b\right)b\partial_{b}.\]

 In a curved space, there are in general no naturally defined

 heuristically as a short line segment going from a point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $p'$

 Let us now explore this heuristic picture, since it provides an important

\end_inset

While finding the exact value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}\circ f$

 Then we obtain the approximate expression

\begin_inset Formula \[

 is the application of the derivation

 Hence,
\begin_inset Formula \[

 It is always possible to find a curve

\begin_layout Standard
Orbits of a nonzero, smooth vector field always exist and are unique because
 they are solutions of ordinary differential equations.
 To see this, consider a local coordinate system 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x^{\alpha}\right\} $
\end_inset

 where a vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is specified by its components 
\begin_inset Formula $v^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}=\sum_{\alpha}v^{\alpha}\mathbf{e}_{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 (the components 
\begin_inset Formula $v^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 can be found as 
\begin_inset Formula $v^{\alpha}=\mathbf{v}\circ x^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

).
 A curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)$
\end_inset

 is specified by 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 coordinate functions 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{\alpha}(\tau)$
\end_inset

.
 The condition 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}(\tau)=\left.\mathbf{v}\right|_{\gamma(\tau)}$
\end_inset

 translates into a system of differential equations,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{d\gamma^{\alpha}(\tau)}{d\tau}=\left.v^{\alpha}\right|_{p=\gamma(\tau)}.\]

\end_inset

We may choose the initial condition as 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{\alpha}(0)=x_{(0)}^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{(0)}^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 are the local coordinates of an initial point of the curve.
 Since the vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is smooth, such a system of equations always has a unique solution 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{\alpha}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 by the well-known theorem of differential calculus.
 This solution 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{\alpha}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 represents the required curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)$
\end_inset

 in the local coordinate system.
 Of course, this system of equations may be complicated and so it is not
 always possible to obtain an 
\emph on
explicit
\emph default
 formula for the solution 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{\alpha}(\tau)$
\end_inset

.
 In most cases, an approximate solution can be found numerically.
 Since solutions 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{\alpha}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 exist and are unique starting from any point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

, the orbits of a nonzero, smooth vector field always form a congruence
 that (at least locally) fills space.

\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)$

\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}=\mathbf{v}$

 everywhere.
 This defines 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 as a scalar function on the manifold.
 We can compute the scalar function 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\circ\tau$
\end_inset

 Along every orbit, we have 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{v}\circ\tau=\frac{d}{d\tau}\tau=1,\]

\series default
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{tangent bundle}

of the manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 The tangent bundle is itself a manifold with dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $2n$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 has dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 This manifold is perhaps not easy to visualize as a whole, but we will
 not need to do anything complicated with the tangent bundle 
\begin_inset Formula $T\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 as a manifold.
 Let us only verify that 
\begin_inset Formula $T\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 has the structure of a smooth manifold.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By assumption, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 is a smooth manifold and, as such, can be covered by a set of charts.
 Consider one such chart that maps a subset 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{U}$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 into a subset 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Tangent vectors at points 
\begin_inset Formula $p\in\mathcal{U}$
\end_inset

 are mapped into tangent vectors in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}$
\end_inset

, which are simply vectors in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

 since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}$
\end_inset

 is a portion of the flat Euclidean space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, the part of 
\begin_inset Formula $T\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 consisting of tangent planes to points 
\begin_inset Formula $p\in\mathcal{U}$
\end_inset

 is one-to-one mapped into 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}\times\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Since the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{V}\times\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

 is a subset of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{n}\times\mathbb{R}^{n}=\mathbb{R}^{2n}$
\end_inset

, we have established that 
\begin_inset Formula $T\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 can be covered by patches, and one can find charts that map these patches
 into 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, the tangent bundle 
\begin_inset Formula $T\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 is a smooth 
\begin_inset Formula $2n$
\end_inset

-dimensional manifold.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Remark:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to realize that the tangent bundle, as a whole manifold,
 is not necessarily equivalent (i.e.\InsetSpace ~
diffeomorphic) to the direct product 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}\times\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

, even though every small patch of 
\begin_inset Formula $T\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 is diffeomorphic to a patch of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}\times\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

.
 The reason is the same as that for the manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 not being diffeomorphic to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

, even though small patches of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 are diffeomorphic to patches of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Namely, the patches may be glued together in a nontrivial way such that
 the global geometry of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 is different from that of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

.
 A detailed consideration would lead us too far into differential topology,
 so I will give only a qualitative example.
 Suppose a diffeomorphism 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi:\mathcal{M}\times\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow T\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 exists, such that every vector space 
\begin_inset Formula $p\times\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $p\in\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

, is mapped one-to-one onto the vector space 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{p}\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 via an invertible linear transformation.
 Then for every 
\begin_inset Formula $p\in\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 one may apply 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $p\times\left\{ 1,0,0,...,0\right\} \in\mathcal{M}\times\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

 and obtain a nonzero vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}(p)\in T_{p}\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 at every point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 However, such a vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

 sometimes cannot exist; a typical example is the 2-sphere 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 It is known that there exists no everywhere nonvanishing and smooth tangent
 vector field on a 2-sphere.
 This property is called the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

impossibility of combing a sphere
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{combing a sphere}

\end_inset

 (see Statement\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Statement-combing-sphere}

\end_inset

).
 So it is impossible to choose even a single nonzero vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

 that smoothly varies throughout the sphere.
 Thus, a diffeomorphism 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi:S^{2}\times\mathbb{R}^{2}\rightarrow TS^{2}$
\end_inset

 does not exist.
 A tangent bundle which is diffeomorphic to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}\times\mathbb{R}^{n}$

Example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a two-dimensional manifold with a local coordinate system 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x,y\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 The gradient of the coordinate function 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is the 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}x$
\end_inset

.
 By definition, this 1-form acts on vector fields 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\textrm{d}x\right)\circ\mathbf{u}=\mathbf{u}\circ x$
\end_inset

.
 For instance, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}=\partial_{x}$
\end_inset

 then obviously 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}\circ x=1$
\end_inset

.
 In this notation, we obtain the equation 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\textrm{d}x\right)\circ\mathbf{u}=\left(\textrm{d}x\right)\circ\partial_{x}=1,\]

\end_inset

 which may look unusual or even confusing at first glance.
 However, it is only the notation that is unusual; the results are always
 consistent.

Consider another vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}=y^{2}\partial_{x}$

.
 The field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 acts on 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 and produces the function 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{v}\circ f=y^{2}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}f(x,y)=2xy^{5}.\]

\end_inset

 The 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}f$
\end_inset

 can be computed using standard rules of calculus as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{d}f=2xy^{3}\textrm{d}x+3x^{2}y^{2}\textrm{d}y.\]

\end_inset

However, note that now

The action of the 1-form

\begin_inset Formula \[
(\textrm{d}f)\circ\mathbf{v}\equiv\mathbf{v}\circ f=2xy^{5}.\]

\end_inset

Let us see how this result can be obtained using the explicit expressions
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}f$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 We have
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
(\textrm{d}f)\circ\mathbf{v} & =\left(2xy^{3}\textrm{d}x+3x^{2}y^{2}\textrm{d}y\right)\circ y^{2}\partial_{x}\\
 & =\left(2xy^{5}\right)\textrm{d}x\circ\partial_{x}+\left(3x^{2}y^{4}\right)\textrm{d}y\circ\partial_{x}.\end{align*}

By definition, 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}x\circ\partial_{x}=1$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}x\circ\partial_{y}=0$

Discussion:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Statement\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{par:Exercise:connecting}

\end_inset

 presents two ways of proving the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\right]$
\end_inset

 is a first-order differential operation, in parts (a) and (b).
 The first proof (a) is performed purely algebraically, using the abstract
 definition of tangent vectors as (unspecified) operations 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\circ(...)$
\end_inset

 with certain properties.
 The other proof (b) uses a specific representation of tangent vectors as
 differential operators 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{\alpha}v^{\alpha}\partial/\partial x^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 in a local coordinate system 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x^{\alpha}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both the proofs have certain advantages and disadvantages.
 The proof (a) is very general because it uses only some properties of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\circ(...)$
\end_inset

.
 So this proof applies not only to directional derivatives but to 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 operation with the properties\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:linearity}

\end_inset

)-(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Leibnitz rule}

\end_inset

), such as the Lie derivative and the covariant derivative that we will
 use later.
 The proof (a) applies equally well to derivatives and to finite difference
 operators, to operators in infinite-dimensional spaces, and so on.
 The proof (a) is also more 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

elegant
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 because it is index-free, does not involve unnecessary structures (such
 as a local coordinate system and a basis), and does not depend on the explicit
 representation of vectors in coordinates.
 This is the kind of proof a mathematician would be looking for.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, the proof (b) is conceptually easier to understand (especiall
y for beginners) because it consists of a specific computation in a familiar
 and elementary context, namely, manipulations with partial derivatives
 of functions.
 Also, the result of the proof (b) is a directly usable formula for the
 components of the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}\right]$
\end_inset

, while the proof (a) merely shows that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}\right]$
\end_inset

 is a well-defined vector.
 In the text that follows, I will usually not need explicit formulas for
 components of vectors, and therefore index-free calculations will be preferable.
 However, in every case one can translate the final results into components
 in a local coordinate system.

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 and a congruence 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 of its orbits (see Fig.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Connecting-vector}

\end_inset

).
 A connecting vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 for the field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 represents arrows between nearby points with equal parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
 This construction can be described more formally as follows.
 For the convenience of our consideration, let us label a subset of the
 orbits by an additional real-valued parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau;s)$
\end_inset

 is a smooth function 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 and the tangent vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is expressed as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}=``\partial\gamma/\partial\tau"$
\end_inset

.
 Using the function 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau;s)$
\end_inset

, we may also consider the curves 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\gamma}(s)\equiv\gamma(\tau_{0};s)$
\end_inset

 for a fixed value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=\tau_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 The curves 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\gamma}(s)$
\end_inset

 go 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

straight across
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the curves 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)$
\end_inset

, intersecting the latter at points of equal 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
 We can then define the tangent vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 to the curves 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\gamma}$
\end_inset

 in the usual way, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}=``\partial\gamma/\partial s"$
\end_inset

.
 The geometric interpretation of the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 is that it points 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sideways
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with respect to the curves 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)$
\end_inset

, connecting a point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 on a curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau;s)$
\end_inset

 to a nearby point 
\begin_inset Formula $p'$
\end_inset

 on a neighbor curve, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau;s')$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s'$
\end_inset

 are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

infinitesimally close
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 while 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 stays constant.
 In other words, the connecting vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

connects
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 neighboring orbits 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)$
\end_inset

 of the field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

corresponding
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 points, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
at points with the same value of the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, the orbits of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 are also lines of constant 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
 Now it is easy to check that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$

 is a connecting vector for

 according to the above definition.

Since the parameter

 many connecting vector fields for a given field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
 The freedom of selecting a connecting field for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is the same as the freedom of choosing the initial values of the parameter

\end_inset

 in such a way that the field

 To find such 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}(p)$
\end_inset

, one needs to solve the equation 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathbf{c},\mathbf{v}\right]=0$
\end_inset

.
 It is easy to see from the coordinate representation
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\mathbf{c},\mathbf{v}\right]=\sum_{\beta}\mathbf{e}_{\beta}\left(\sum_{\alpha}c^{\alpha}\frac{\partial v^{\beta}}{\partial x^{\alpha}}-\sum_{\alpha}v^{\alpha}\frac{\partial c^{\beta}}{\partial x^{\alpha}}\right)\]

\end_inset

that the equation 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathbf{c},\mathbf{v}\right]=0$
\end_inset

 is a linear differential equation for the unknown vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 that involves only the derivative of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 along the orbits of

Using Eq.\InsetSpace ~

By definition of the 1-form

 Using the Leibnitz rule, we compute

\begin_layout Subsection
Geometric interpretation 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{Lie derivative!interpretation}

\end_inset

To illustrate the geometric significance of the Lie derivative, we first
 note that the Lie derivative of a connecting vector field is zero.
 A connecting vector, such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 in Fig.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Connecting-vector}

\end_inset

, is transported from the initial point by the flow of the field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
 We can imagine that the entire neighborhood of points around the initial
 point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is transported along the orbits of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 to another nearby point 
\begin_inset Formula $p'$
\end_inset

; this neighborhood is deformed in a certain way by the transport.
 The character of this deformation is determined by the vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 in the neighborhood of the initial point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and along the way to 
\begin_inset Formula $p'$
\end_inset

.
 Tangent vectors at 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 can be visualized as directions towards points near 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 So all tangent vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},...\in T_{p}\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 are also transported to particular tangent vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}',\mathbf{b}',...\in T_{p'}\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 (see Fig.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:The-tangent-space-flow}

\end_inset

).
 Thus the flow of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 determines a map between tangent spaces 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{p}\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{p'}\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

, as long as the points 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p'$
\end_inset

 lie on a single orbit of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$

We have already seen (Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Connecting-vectors}

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 obtained by transporting an initial vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\left.\mathbf{u}\right|_{p}$
\end_inset

 along the flow of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 satisfies 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{u}=0$
\end_inset

.
 (The transport from an initial point defines the vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 along a single orbit of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

, so we need to use many orbits and many initial values to define the vector
 field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 everywhere.) In general, for two vector fields 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 we will have 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{u}\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 So we might say (heuristically) that the Lie derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 measures the extent to which a vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 fails to be a connecting field for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Standard
To make these considerations somewhat more precise, let us temporarily denote
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{\tau}:T_{p}\mathcal{M}\rightarrow T_{p'}\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 the map that transports tangent vectors along the orbits of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 from point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 to point 
\begin_inset Formula $p'$

\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 is the parameter distance between 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p'$
\end_inset

.
 (In other words, we introduce a curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 parameterized by 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(0)=p$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)=p'$
\end_inset

, while 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}=\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 everywhere along 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

.) In this notation, the vectors in Fig.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:The-tangent-space-flow}

\end_inset

 satisfy
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{a}'=\varphi_{\tau}\left(\mathbf{a}\right),\quad\mathbf{b}'=\varphi_{\tau}\left(\mathbf{b}\right).\]

\end_inset

Now we would like to compute the Lie derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 is some vector field.
 Let us compute 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 at point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

; let us assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 is very small and so 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is a vector pointing from 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $p'$
\end_inset

.
 We might try to write the derivative of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 along 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 at point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\lim_{\tau\rightarrow0}\frac{\left.\mathbf{u}\right|_{p'}-\left.\mathbf{u}\right|_{p}}{\tau},\quad???\]

\end_inset

but this expression is meaningless since we cannot subtract vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 at different points: these vectors belong to different tangent spaces.
 However, we can transport 
\begin_inset Formula $\left.\mathbf{u}\right|_{p'}\in T_{p'}\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 back to the tangent space 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{p}\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 using the inverse map 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{\tau}^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 So we write the derivative of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 along 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 at point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{u}=\lim_{\tau\rightarrow0}\frac{\varphi_{\tau}^{-1}\left(\left.\mathbf{u}\right|_{p'}\right)-\left.\mathbf{u}\right|_{p}}{\tau}.\label{eq:Lie derivative formula phi}\end{equation}

\end_inset

The geometric interpretation of this expression is clear: 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 is the extent to which the field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 fails to be transported along 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$

Similar considerations apply to the Lie derivative of a tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 with respect to a vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
 Any tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 can be defined as a multilinear function of tangent vectors and covectors,
 while vectors and covectors are defined through the points in an infinitesimal
 neighborhood of 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, any tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is ultimately an object defined through combinations of points near 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 When these points are transported by the flow of a vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

, the corresponding transport 
\begin_inset Formula $\varphi_{\tau}(A)$
\end_inset

 of the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is also well-defined.
 Then the Lie derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{v}}A$
\end_inset

 is defined by a formula analogous to Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Lie derivative formula phi}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It follows from expressions derived above that the Lie derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $\left.\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{v}}A\right|_{p}$

\begin_inset Formula $A$

 at a point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 contains not only derivatives of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 but also derivatives of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
 So the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\left.\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{v}}A\right|_{p}$
\end_inset

 depends not only on the value 
\begin_inset Formula $\left.\mathbf{v}\right|_{p}$
\end_inset

 but also on the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 in an entire neighborhood of 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 Thus the Lie derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $\left.\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{v}}A\right|_{p}$

 is not a true directional derivative of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

 in the direction of

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $p$

 Such a true directional derivative cannot be defined without introducing
 some additional structures on the manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$

 This is so because the tensors 
\begin_inset Formula $A(p)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A(p')$
\end_inset

 at neighboring points belong to different tensor spaces, and thus there
 is no definition for a quantity such as 
\begin_inset Formula $A(p')-A(p)$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly, there is no possibility to integrate vectors or tensors over
 a domain.
 We might say, in figurative language, that the tangent spaces 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

are disconnected
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 and a directional derivative cannot be computed without a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{v}}$
\end_inset

, the information about how to connect the tangent spaces comes from the
 flow of the vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$

 This allows us to relate directions around

 However, this procedure uses information about the vector field

\begin_layout Standard
The calculus of differential forms is a basic tool of differential geometry.
 Differential forms are not widely used in standard texts on GR because
 they do not provide a decisive computational advantage as long as one remains
 within the standard introductory material.
 A substantial computational advantage of differential forms is first seen
 when considering more advanced material, such as the Frobenius theorem
 or the tetrad formulation of GR.
 However, the calculus of forms is relatively simple, and in my view the
 learning effort involved is amply justified by the conceptual advantages
 and wide-ranging applicability of differential forms in theoretical physics
 and mathematics.
 In the following subsections I explain the motivation for introducing different
ial forms.
 Then (Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Antisymmetric tensors}

\end_inset

 mostly without proof.
 Since the calculus of forms is standard material and since it will be used

 suffice.

\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{A}$

 over the conventional (unsigned) area

\begin_layout Standard
The oriented area 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{A}(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})$
\end_inset

 is by definition antisymmetric in 
\begin_inset Formula $(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})$
\end_inset

, since the pair 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v},\mathbf{u}\right\} $
\end_inset

 has opposite orientation to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 The fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{A}(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})$
\end_inset

 is an bilinear form can be demonstrated quite straightforwardly.
 When one of the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is multiplied by a positive number, the area of a parallelogram is multiplied
 by the same number.
 If one of the vectors is multiplied by a negative number, the orientation
 of the pair 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is reversed and thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{A}(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})$
\end_inset

 changes sign.
 We also have 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{A}(0,\mathbf{v})=0$
\end_inset

.
 So it is easy to see that 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{A}(\lambda\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})=\lambda\tilde{A}(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is an arbitrary real number (positive, zero, or negative).
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{A}(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})=-\tilde{A}(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{u})$
\end_inset

, the same property holds for the argument 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
 Further, one can show by an elementary geometric construction (see Fig.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Area-of-the-parallelogram}

\end_inset

) that the area does not change when a multiple of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is added to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

, namely
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tilde{A}(\mathbf{u}+\lambda\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})=\tilde{A}(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}).\]

\end_inset

In two dimensions, two vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}\right\} $
\end_inset

 are a basis if 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{A}(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 It follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{A}$
\end_inset

 is linear in each argument: we can compute 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{A}(\mathbf{u}_{1}+\mathbf{u}_{2},\mathbf{v})$
\end_inset

 by decomposing 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{1}=\lambda_{1}\mathbf{u}+\mu_{1}\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{2}=\lambda_{2}\mathbf{u}+\mu_{2}\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

, and then it is easy to see that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tilde{A}(\mathbf{u}_{1}+\mathbf{u}_{2},\mathbf{v})=\tilde{A}(\mathbf{u}_{1},\mathbf{v})+\tilde{A}(\mathbf{u}_{2},\mathbf{v}).\]

\end_inset

The same property holds for the argument 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{A}(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})$
\end_inset

 is an antisymmetric bilinear form that we may call the

To make the above discussion less abstract, let us express all quantities
 in Cartesian coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x,y\right\} $
\end_inset

 The vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 have components 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ u_{1},u_{2}\right\} $

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula \[
A(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})=\sqrt{\left(u_{1}^{2}+u_{2}^{2}\right)\left(v_{1}^{2}+v_{2}^{2}\right)-\left(u_{1}v_{1}+u_{2}v_{2}\right)^{2}}.\]

\end_inset

After some algebraic simplification, this becomes
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
A(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})=\sqrt{\left(u_{1}v_{2}-u_{2}v_{1}\right)^{2}}=\left|u_{1}v_{2}-u_{2}v_{1}\right|.\label{eq:unoriented area}\end{equation}

\end_inset

Now it is clear that 
\begin_inset Formula $A(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})$
\end_inset

 is the absolute value of a 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{A}$
\end_inset

 defined by
\begin_inset Formula \[

u_{1} & v_{1}\\
u_{2} & v_{2}\end{array}\right|.\]

\end_inset

The sign of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{A}$
\end_inset

 is chosen such that the area of the unit square spanned by the unit basis
 vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 1,0\right\} $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} $
\end_inset

 (in this order) is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $1$

A somewhat more complicated concept is the area of a parallelogram spanned

 The ordinary (unoriented) area

\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{A}(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})$

 This function is the familiar vector product of the vectors

\begin_inset Formula \[

 Indeed, it is well known that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left|\mathbf{u}\times\mathbf{v}\right|=\left|\mathbf{u}\right|\left|\mathbf{v}\right|\sin\alpha=A(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}).\]

Thus, one could say that in three dimensions the area has an orientation

\begin_layout Standard
Let us begin by considering an example familiar from mechanics.
 Suppose a particle moves in three-dimensional space along a curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}(\tau)\equiv\left\{ X(\tau),Y(\tau),Z(\tau)\right\} $
\end_inset

 and experiences a space-dependent external force 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}\equiv\left\{ F_{1},F_{2},F_{3}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 The work done by the force can be computed as the 
\series bold
line integral
\series default
,
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{line integral}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
W=\int_{\mathbf{x}(\tau)}\left(F_{1}dx+F_{2}dy+F_{3}dz\right).\label{eq:line integral W}\end{equation}

\end_inset

This expression is computed as the ordinary integral
\begin_inset Formula \[
W=\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}\left(F_{1}\dot{X}+F_{2}\dot{Y}+F_{3}\dot{Z}\right)d\tau.\]

\end_inset

 However, this form of the expression requires a parameterization 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}(\tau)$
\end_inset

, while the work 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 is actually independent of the choice of the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 along the curve: it depends only on the force 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}$
\end_inset

 and on the layout of the given curve in space.
 So it is more natural to work with the line integral\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:line integral W}

\end_inset

).
 We can interpret the integrand in Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:line integral W}

\end_inset

) directly as a 1-form
\begin_inset Formula \[
\omega\equiv F_{1}\textrm{d}x+F_{2}\textrm{d}y+F_{3}\textrm{d}z.\]

\end_inset

Note that the tangent vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\mathbf{x}}d\tau$
\end_inset

 is an approximate representation of a short curve segment (see Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Short-curve-segments}

\end_inset

) between the points 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}(\tau+d\tau)$
\end_inset

.
 The expression 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(F_{1}\dot{X}+F_{2}\dot{Y}+F_{3}\dot{Z}\right)d\tau=\omega\circ\dot{\mathbf{x}}d\tau\]

\end_inset

is interpreted as the 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 evaluated on the tangent vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\mathbf{x}}d\tau$
\end_inset

.
 This expression represents a small amount of work done along a short curve
 segment.
 So the line integral\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:line integral W}

\end_inset

) is rewritten as
\begin_inset Formula \[
W=\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}\left(\omega\circ\dot{\mathbf{x}}\right)d\tau\equiv\int_{\gamma}\omega,\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$

\begin_layout Standard
In general, one defines the integral of a 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 over a curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 as follows.
 One splits the curve into a large number 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 of short segments.
 Each segment is almost straight and thus can be approximately represented
 by a tangent vector (see Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Short-curve-segments}

\end_inset

).
 Thus we represent the 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 segments by 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 tangent vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}$
\end_inset

, ..., 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{N}$
\end_inset

.
 Each segment contributes to the integral a small amount computed as 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega(\mathbf{v}_{j})$
\end_inset

.
 The integral 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\gamma}\omega$
\end_inset

 is then defined as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int_{\gamma}\omega=\lim_{N\rightarrow\infty}\sum_{j=1}^{N}\omega(\mathbf{v}_{j}).\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The line integral 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\gamma}\omega$
\end_inset

 can be reduced to an ordinary integral by choosing a parameterization 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)$
\end_inset

 for the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 and writing
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\int_{\gamma}\omega=\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}\omega(\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}})d\tau.\label{eq:integral of 1-form over a curve}\end{equation}

\end_inset

It is easy to see that the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\gamma}\omega$
\end_inset

 actually does not depend on the choice of the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 along the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

.
 (A redefinition 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\tau}=f(\tau)$
\end_inset

 will introduce a factor of 
\begin_inset Formula $f'$
\end_inset

 into 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}$
\end_inset

, while a compensating factor 
\begin_inset Formula $1/f'$
\end_inset

 will come from 
\begin_inset Formula $d\tilde{\tau}$
\end_inset

.) The reason is that the line integral 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\gamma}\omega$
\end_inset

 is defined purely geometrically through splitting of the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 into small segments.
 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\gamma}\omega$
\end_inset

 is a geometrically defined quantity that is independent of the coordinate
 representation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 and of the choice of the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The calculus of 1-forms is designed to be compatible with the change of
 variables under the integral.
 For instance, consider an ordinary integral 
\begin_inset Formula $\int f(x)dx$

 After a change of variable 
\begin_inset Formula $x=X(\phi)$
\end_inset

, the integral becomes
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int f(x)dx=\int f(X(\phi))\frac{dX}{d\phi}d\phi.\]

\end_inset

This corresponds precisely to the chain rule for the differential operator
 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
f(x)\textrm{d}x=f(x)\textrm{d}X(\phi)=f(x)X'(\phi)\textrm{d}\phi.\]

\end_inset

So it is consistent to interpret the expression 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)dx$

 within an ordinary integral as a 1-form

 is computed as a repeated ordinary integral,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\iint F(x,y)dxdy=\int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}}dx\int_{y_{1}}^{y_{2}}dy\, F(x,y).\label{eq:surface integral as a repeated integral}\end{equation}

\end_inset

Now we would like to interpret the expression 
\begin_inset Formula $F(x,y)dxdy$
\end_inset

 as an analog and a generalization of the 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)\textrm{d}x$
\end_inset

 seen in the previous example.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As in the previous example, we can divide the surface of integration into
 a large number 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 of small rectangles with sides 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta y$
\end_inset

.
 The sides of each rectangle are approximately represented by a pair of
 tangent vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{u}_{j},\mathbf{v}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $j=1,...,N$
\end_inset

.
 A rectangle number 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 located at the point 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x_{j},y_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 gives a small contribution 
\begin_inset Formula $F(x_{j},y_{j})\delta x\delta y$
\end_inset

 to the integral.
 It is clear that the number 
\begin_inset Formula $F(x_{j},y_{j})\delta x\delta y$
\end_inset

 can be understood as the evaluation of a bilinear form 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 acting on tangent vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{u}_{j},\mathbf{v}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

, i.e.
\begin_inset Formula \[
F(x_{j},y_{j})\delta x\delta y\equiv\omega\left(\mathbf{u}_{j},\mathbf{v}_{j}\right).\]

\end_inset

The bilinear form 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 is called a 
\series bold
2-form
\series default
 since it has 
\emph on
two
\emph default
 vector arguments.
 Then the surface integral is defined as the limit
\begin_inset Formula \[
\iint Fdxdy=\lim_{N\rightarrow\infty}\sum_{j=1}^{N}\omega\left(\mathbf{u}_{j},\mathbf{v}_{j}\right).\]

\end_inset

 The 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 can be temporarily written as 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega=F\textrm{d}x\,\textrm{d}y$
\end_inset

.
 Let us now explore its properties under the change of variables in the
 integral.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We first perform a simple change of variables, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x,y\right\} \rightarrow\left\{ x,\phi\right\} $
\end_inset

, where we replace 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $y=Y(x,\phi)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 is a fixed function.
 To transform the integral, it is convenient to use the formula\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:surface integral as a repeated integral}

\end_inset

).
 Since the variable 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is held fixed within the integration over 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

, we find 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}}dx\int_{y_{1}}^{y_{2}}dy\, F(x,y)=\int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}}dx\int_{\Phi_{1}(x)}^{\Phi_{2}(x)}d\phi\, F(x,Y)\frac{\partial Y(x,\phi)}{\partial\phi}.\]

\end_inset

Hence, if we wish to interpret the expression 
\begin_inset Formula $F\textrm{d}x\,\textrm{d}y$
\end_inset

 consistently as a bilinear form, we must adopt the rule
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{d}x\,\textrm{d}Y(x,\phi)=\frac{\partial Y(x,\phi)}{\partial\phi}\textrm{d}x\,\textrm{d}\phi.\]

\end_inset

However, according to the calculus of 1-forms, we have
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{d}Y(x,\phi)=\frac{\partial Y}{\partial x}\textrm{d}x+\frac{\partial Y}{\partial\phi}\textrm{d}\phi\]

\end_inset

and (assuming that the product 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}x\,\textrm{d}y$
\end_inset

 is bilinear)
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{d}x\,\textrm{d}Y(x,\phi)=\textrm{d}x\,\left(\frac{\partial Y}{\partial x}\textrm{d}x+\frac{\partial Y}{\partial\phi}\textrm{d}\phi\right).\]

\end_inset

Therefore, this calculus is consistent with the properties of two-dimensional
 integration only if we assume that
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{d}x\,\textrm{d}x=0.\]

\end_inset

Now it is clear that the 2-form 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}x\,\textrm{d}y$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 must be a rather special kind of product of 1-forms 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}y$
\end_inset

.
 This product is called the 
\series bold
exterior product 
\series default
(also 
\series bold
wedge product
\series default
) and is denoted by the symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge$
\end_inset

; so one writes 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}x\wedge\textrm{d}y$
\end_inset

 rather than 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}x\,\textrm{d}y$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The property
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{d}x\wedge\textrm{d}x=0\]

\end_inset

together with bilinearity means that the exterior product is 
\emph on
antisymmetric
\emph default
.
 To see this, consider
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{d}\left(x+y\right)\wedge\textrm{d}\left(x+y\right)=0\;\Rightarrow\;\textrm{d}x\wedge\textrm{d}y+\textrm{d}y\wedge\textrm{d}x=0.\]

\end_inset

Let us now check the consistency of a more general change of variables,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x,y\right\} \rightarrow\left\{ \phi,\psi\right\} $
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $x=X(\phi,\psi)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y=Y(\phi,\psi)$
\end_inset

.
 Calculations are straightforward because the only new rule is the antisymmetry
 of the exterior product.
 We find
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
\textrm{d}x\wedge\textrm{d}y & =\textrm{d}X(\phi,\psi)\wedge\textrm{d}Y(\phi,\psi)\nonumber \\
 & =\left(\frac{\partial X}{\partial\phi}\textrm{d}\phi+\frac{\partial X}{\partial\psi}\textrm{d}\psi\right)\wedge\left(\frac{\partial Y}{\partial\phi}\textrm{d}\phi+\frac{\partial Y}{\partial\psi}\textrm{d}\psi\right)\nonumber \\
 & =\left(\frac{\partial X}{\partial\phi}\frac{\partial Y}{\partial\psi}-\frac{\partial X}{\partial\psi}\frac{\partial Y}{\partial\phi}\right)\textrm{d}\phi\wedge\textrm{d}\psi,\label{eq:two-dimensional Jacobian}\end{align}

\end_inset

where we used the antisymmetry properties 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{d}\phi\wedge\textrm{d}\phi=\textrm{d}\psi\wedge\textrm{d}\psi=0,\quad\textrm{d}\phi\wedge\textrm{d}\psi+\textrm{d}\psi\wedge\textrm{d}\phi=0,\]

\end_inset

to get the last line.
 Now we may recognize Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:two-dimensional Jacobian}

\end_inset

) as the standard formula for the change of variables, involving the two-dimensi
onal Jacobian of the transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x,y\right\} \rightarrow\left\{ \phi,\psi\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 In this way, we can see that the unusual rule of the exterior product is
 a natural consequence of the known properties of multiple integration.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Standard
However, note that we obtained the Jacobian itself rather than its absolute
 value, which one has in formulas involving the area of domain.
 This is consistent because integrals of 2-forms are defined on 
\emph on
oriented
\emph default
 surfaces and are not merely integrals of the ordinary, unsigned area.
 Reversing the orientation of the surface will reverse the sign of the integral.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The geometric formulation of the surface integral is therefore the integral
 of a 2-form over a surface, written as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int_{\mathcal{A}}\omega,\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}$
\end_inset

 is a surface (or part of a surface) and 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 is a 2-form.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The same formulation applies to integrals over surfaces embedded in a higher-dim
ensional space.
 Consider another example familiar from physics: the flux of a magnetic
 field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{B}$
\end_inset

 through a surface 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}$
\end_inset

 is computed as a surface integral 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Phi=\int_{\mathcal{A}}\mathbf{B}\cdot d\mathbf{S},\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $d\mathbf{S}$
\end_inset

 is understood as a vector-valued 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

infinitesimal surface element.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The flux integral is usually written in components, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{B}\equiv\left\{ B_{x},B_{y},B_{z}\right\} $
\end_inset

, as follows: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int_{\mathcal{A}}\left(B_{x}dydz+B_{y}dxdz+B_{z}dxdy\right).\]

\end_inset

However, this notation needs to be supplemented by a complicated prescription
 for the orientation of the surface elements.
 Integrals of this kind become more transparent in the notation of 2-forms.
 One introduces the 2-form
\begin_inset Formula \[
\boldsymbol{\beta}\equiv B_{x}\textrm{d}y\wedge\textrm{d}z+B_{y}\textrm{d}z\wedge\textrm{d}x+B_{z}\textrm{d}x\wedge\textrm{d}y\]

\end_inset

and expresses the flux 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Phi=\int_{\mathcal{A}}\boldsymbol{\beta}.\]

\end_inset

The (somewhat complicated) rules for changing variables in such integrals,
 as well as the orientation prescriptions, are automatically reproduced
 by the calculus of differential forms.
 The rules of this calculus are simple: one just needs to use the chain
 rule for 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}$
\end_inset

 and the antisymmetry of 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly, one can treat a three-dimensional integral, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\iiint F(x,y,z)dxdydz,\]

\end_inset

as an integral of the 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

-form 
\begin_inset Formula $F(x,y,z)\textrm{d}x\wedge\textrm{d}y\wedge\textrm{d}z$
\end_inset

 over a three-dimensional manifold (or part of a manifold).
 The same rules will provide the correct formulas under any changes of variables
 in the integral.
 Collectively, 
\begin_inset Formula $n$

\begin_inset Formula $\theta=x\textrm{d}y+y\textrm{d}z$
\end_inset

 The exterior product of

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 is computed as follows,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\eta\wedge\theta & =\left(y\textrm{d}x-2\textrm{d}z\right)\wedge\left(x\textrm{d}y+y\textrm{d}z\right)\\

\end_inset

(we used 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}y\wedge\textrm{d}z=-\textrm{d}z\wedge\textrm{d}y$
\end_inset

).
 Let us now compute how the 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta\wedge\theta$
\end_inset

 acts on a pair of vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}=5\partial_{x}-y\partial_{z}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}=\partial_{x}+3z\partial_{y}$

\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}y\circ\mathbf{u}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}z\circ\mathbf{v}=0$
\end_inset

, which simplifies the calculations:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\left(\textrm{d}x\wedge\textrm{d}y\right)\circ\left(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}\right) & =\left(\textrm{d}x\circ\mathbf{u}\right)\left(\textrm{d}y\circ\mathbf{v}\right)=15z,\\

\begin_inset Formula \[

 If the set

\end_inset

 in the

 So the exterior product is (by definition) an alternating linear combination
 of tensor products of basis 1-forms,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\omega_{1}\wedge...\wedge\omega_{k}=\sum_{\sigma}\left(-1\right)^{\left|\sigma\right|}\omega_{\sigma(1)}\otimes...\otimes\omega_{\sigma(k)},\]

where the sum is over all permutations 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$

 Since the set of all basis tensors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \omega_{j_{1}}\otimes...\otimes\omega_{j_{k}}\right\} $

 is by definition linearly independent, the linear combination cannot vanish.

By analogy with the exterior product of forms, one can define the exterior
 product of vectors.
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{exterior product!of vectors}

\end_inset

 For instance, the exterior product of two vectors is the antisymmetric
 tensor defined by
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{x}\wedge\mathbf{y}\equiv\mathbf{x}\otimes\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{y}\otimes\mathbf{x};\quad(\mathbf{x}\wedge\mathbf{y})^{\alpha\beta}=x^{\alpha}y^{\beta}-x^{\beta}y^{\alpha}.\]

\end_inset

One can consider the vector space of linear combinations of such exterior
 products; this is the space of antisymmetric tensors of rank (2,0).
 Similarly, the exterior product of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 vectors is an antisymmetric tensor of rank (
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

,0).
 Such totally antisymmetric tensors are sometimes called 
\begin_inset Formula $n$

 For example, a 2-form

\begin_inset Formula \[

Notice the appearance of an extra factor 
\begin_inset Formula $2$

 In the case of

\begin_layout Standard
Some textbooks use extra factors of

\end_inset

 when defining the exterior product of

 Then extra factors of 
\begin_inset Formula $n!$

 will appear in some equations but disappear from some other equations.
 These factors play no essential role, i.e.\InsetSpace ~

The ordinary (scalar) volume of the parallelepiped spanned by

\end_inset

 The norm 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\mathbf{a}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{a}_{n}\right|$
\end_inset

 is defined in the usual manner through the scalar product on the space
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-vectors, which is in turn defined through the scalar product in the vector
 space.
 For instance, the area of a parallelogram spanned by two vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\right\} $
\end_inset

 in an 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

-dimensional Euclidean space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{N}$
\end_inset

 is calculated as follows.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

oriented area
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the parallelogram is represented by the bivector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 Using the standard Cartesian basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},...,\mathbf{e}_{N}\right\} $
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{N}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{i}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $1\leq i<j\leq N$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $A_{ij}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}=\sum_{1\leq i<j\leq N}A_{ij}\mathbf{e}_{i}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{j}.\]

\end_inset

The scalar product is then defined in the space of bivectors by postulating
 that the bivectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{i}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 constitute an orthonormal basis.
 The scalar product of two arbitrary bivectors is then computed as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\sum_{i,j}A_{ij}\mathbf{e}_{i}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{j}\right)\cdot\left(\sum_{i,j}A_{ij}\mathbf{e}_{i}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{j}\right)=\sum_{i,j}A_{ij}B_{ij}\]

\end_inset

(all the sums are taken over 
\begin_inset Formula $1\leq i<j\leq N$
\end_inset

).
 Hence, the ordinary (scalar) area of the parallelogram is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{Area}\left(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\right)=\sqrt{\sum_{1\leq i<j\leq N}\left|A_{ij}\right|^{2}}.\]

 The volume of a parallelepiped spanned by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is, by definition, equal to 1.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a basis, there exists a linear transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{T}$
\end_inset

 that brings 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 into the given set of vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 By Statement\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Statement-determinants}

\end_inset

, the volume of the parallelepiped spanned by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{T}$
\end_inset

, so it remains to compute that determinant.
 Let us introduce the components of the transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{T}$
\end_inset

 in the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{v}_{j}\equiv\hat{T}\mathbf{e}_{j}=\sum_{k}T_{jk}\mathbf{e}_{k}.\]

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{k}\cdot\mathbf{e}_{l}=\delta_{kl}$
\end_inset

, we can express the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{ij}$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula \[
g_{ij}=\mathbf{v}_{i}\cdot\mathbf{v}_{j}=\left(\sum_{k}T_{ik}\mathbf{e}_{k}\right)\cdot\left(\sum_{l}T_{jl}\mathbf{e}_{l}\right)=\sum_{k}T_{ik}T_{jk}.\]

\end_inset

It follows that the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{ij}$
\end_inset

 is equal to the product of two matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{ij}$
\end_inset

 Therefore, the determinant of 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{ij}$
\end_inset

 is found as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\det g_{ij}=\left(\det T_{ij}\right)\left(\det T_{ji}\right)=\left(\det T_{ij}\right)^{2},\]

\end_inset

where we used the fact that the determinant of the transposed matrix is
 the same as the determinant of the original matrix.
 Hence, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{Vol}\left(\mathbf{v}_{1},...,\mathbf{v}_{n}\right)=\det T_{ij}=\sqrt{\det g_{ij}},\]

\end_inset

which is the desired formula.

Example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider 1-forms 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{1}=x^{2}\textrm{d}y$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{2}=xy\textrm{d}x+2\textrm{d}y$
\end_inset

.
 The exterior differential of 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{1}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{d}\omega_{1}=\textrm{d}\left(x^{2}\textrm{d}y\right)=2x\textrm{d}x\wedge\textrm{d}y+x^{2}\textrm{d}\left(\textrm{d}y\right)=2x\textrm{d}x\wedge\textrm{d}y,\]

\end_inset

because 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\left(\textrm{d}y\right)=0$
\end_inset

.
 Let us compute 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\omega_{2}$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\textrm{d}\omega_{2} & =\textrm{d}(xy)\wedge\textrm{d}x+xy\textrm{d}\left(\textrm{d}x\right)+2\textrm{d}\left(\textrm{d}y\right)\\
 & =y\textrm{d}x\wedge\textrm{d}x+x\textrm{d}y\wedge\textrm{d}x\\
 & =-x\textrm{d}x\wedge\textrm{d}y,\end{align*}

\end_inset

because 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}x\wedge\textrm{d}x=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}y\wedge\textrm{d}x=-\textrm{d}x\wedge\textrm{d}y$
\end_inset

 due to antisymmetry.
 Consider now the differential of 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\omega_{2}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{d}\left(\textrm{d}\omega_{2}\right)=\textrm{d}\left(-x\textrm{d}x\wedge\textrm{d}y\right)=-\textrm{d}x\wedge\textrm{d}x\wedge\textrm{d}y=0.\]

\end_inset

Another example calculation is
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{d}\left(xy\textrm{d}x\wedge\textrm{d}z\right)=\textrm{d}\left(xy\right)\wedge\textrm{d}x\wedge\textrm{d}z=-x\textrm{d}x\wedge\textrm{d}y\wedge\textrm{d}z.\]

\end_inset

In this way, arbitrary differentials can be computed.

A rather cumbersome but explicit formula can be derived for the differential

 of an arbitrary

\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}

 of the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{s}$
\end_inset

 among the listed arguments of 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

.
 As an example of using this formula, consider a 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\omega$
\end_inset

 is the 2-form defined by
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
(\textrm{d}\omega)\circ(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\equiv\mathbf{x}\circ\left(\omega(\mathbf{y})\right)-\mathbf{y}\circ\left(\omega(\mathbf{x})\right)-\omega(\left[\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\right]).\label{eq:dw 12}\end{equation}

\end_inset

It is straightforward to check that this formula actually defines a bilinear
 map 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\omega$
\end_inset

 that does not contain derivatives of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$

Obviously the formula\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:dw 12}

) defines an antisymmetric function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\right)$
\end_inset

 So it is sufficient to show that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
(\textrm{d}\omega)\circ(\lambda\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=\lambda(\textrm{d}\omega)\circ(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\]

\end_inset

when 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is a scalar function of a point.
 Once this is proved, it will follow that 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\omega$

\begin_layout Standard
The remaining part of the proof is thus a straightforward calculation:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
(\textrm{d}\omega)\circ(\lambda\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}) & =\lambda\mathbf{x}\circ\omega(\mathbf{y})-\mathbf{y}\circ\left(\lambda\omega(\mathbf{x})\right)-\omega(\left[\lambda\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\right])\\
 & =\lambda\left(\mathbf{x}\circ\omega(\mathbf{y})-\mathbf{y}\circ\omega(\mathbf{x})-\omega(\left[\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\right])\right)\\
 & \quad-\left(\mathbf{y}\circ\lambda\right)\omega(\mathbf{x})+\omega\left(\left(\mathbf{y}\circ\lambda\right)\mathbf{x}\right)\\
 & =\lambda(\textrm{d}\omega)\circ(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}).\end{align*}

\end_inset

The insertion operator produces 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(n-1\right)$
\end_inset

-forms out of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-forms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Lie derivative operation can be expressed through 
\begin_inset Formula $\iota$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}$
\end_inset

.
 To see how, let us first compute 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{v}}\omega$
\end_inset

 for some 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 and vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
 The 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{v}}\omega$
\end_inset

 acts on an arbitrary vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{v}}\omega\right)\circ\mathbf{u}=\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{v}}\left(\omega\circ\mathbf{u}\right)-\omega\circ\left(\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{u}\right)=\mathbf{v}\circ\left(\omega(\mathbf{u})\right)-\omega([\mathbf{v},\mathbf{u}]).\]

\end_inset

Let us compare this with the formula\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:dw 12}

\end_inset

) for 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\omega$
\end_inset

; by inspection, we notice that
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{v}}\omega\right)\circ\mathbf{u}=\left(\textrm{d}\omega\right)\circ\left(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{u}\right)+\mathbf{u}\circ\left(\omega(\mathbf{v})\right).\]

\end_inset

Using the insertion operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\iota_{\mathbf{v}}$
\end_inset

, we can rewrite this as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{v}}\omega\right)\circ\mathbf{u}=\left(\iota_{\mathbf{v}}\left(\textrm{d}\omega\right)\right)\circ\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{u}\circ\left(\iota_{\mathbf{v}}\omega\right).\]

\end_inset

Finally, note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\iota_{\mathbf{v}}\omega$
\end_inset

 is a scalar function, so
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{u}\circ\left(\iota_{\mathbf{v}}\omega\right)\equiv\left(\textrm{d}\left(\iota_{\mathbf{v}}\omega\right)\right)\circ\mathbf{u}.\]

\end_inset

Thus
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{v}}\omega\right)\circ\mathbf{u}=\left(\iota_{\mathbf{v}}\left(\textrm{d}\omega\right)+\textrm{d}\left(\iota_{\mathbf{v}}\omega\right)\right)\circ\mathbf{u}.\]

\end_inset

Omitting the arbitrary vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

, we obtain the 
\series bold
Cartan homotopy formula
\series default

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{Cartan homotopy formula}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{v}}\omega=\textrm{d}\left(\iota_{\mathbf{v}}\omega\right)+\iota_{\mathbf{v}}\left(\textrm{d}\omega\right),\]

\end_inset

written also more concisely as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{v}}=\textrm{d}\iota_{\mathbf{v}}+\iota_{\mathbf{v}}\textrm{d}.\label{eq:Cartan homotopy formula}\end{equation}

\end_inset

This important formula holds not only for 1-forms, but also for arbitrary
 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-forms 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

.
 Note that the exterior differential 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}$
\end_inset

 brings 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-forms into 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(n+1\right)$
\end_inset

-forms, while 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{v}}$
\end_inset

 does not change the number of arguments of

-forms.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We consider an 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-dimensional smooth manifold.
 In a local coordinate system 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x_{1},...,x_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

, an arbitrary 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 can be expressed as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\Omega=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j=1}^{n}\Omega_{ij}(x_{1},...,x_{n})\textrm{d}x_{i}\wedge\textrm{d}x_{j},\label{eq:Omega decomposition general}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{ij}=-\Omega_{ji}$
\end_inset

 is an 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

-dependent matrix.
 However, the coordinate system may be chosen so that a particular 2-form
 is written in a simpler way.
 For example, a closed 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\boldsymbol{A}=\textrm{d}x_{1}\wedge\textrm{d}x_{2}+x_{3}\textrm{d}x_{1}\wedge\textrm{d}x_{3}\]

\end_inset

can be rewritten as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\boldsymbol{A}=\textrm{d}x_{1}\wedge\textrm{d}\left(x_{2}+\frac{1}{2}x_{3}^{2}\right)=\textrm{d}x_{1}\wedge\textrm{d}y_{2},\quad y_{2}\equiv x_{2}+\frac{1}{2}x_{3}^{2}.\]

\end_inset

In this example, a particular choice of the new coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x_{1},y_{2},x_{3},...,x_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 reduces the 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{A}$
\end_inset

 to a simpler expression involving just two of the coordinates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is useful to know how many different coordinates are needed to represent
 a given 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$

 in the simplest possible way.
 Of course, it is also useful to be able to 
\emph on
determine
\emph default
 the new coordinates explicitly if a closed 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$

 is specified in a given coordinate system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 a suitable local coordinate system 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x_{1},...,x_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 can be found such that

\begin_inset Formula $k\leq n/2$

\begin_layout Standard
It is advantageous to find such 
\series bold

 local coordinates because then calculations with

 The required number 
\begin_inset Formula $2k\leq n$

 of different coordinates in the decomposition\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:omega decomposition}

\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{rank of 2-form}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a closed 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 is given in a certain coordinate system, can one determine the rank of
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 without knowing the canonical coordinates (but knowing that they exist)?
 In the example with the 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{A}$
\end_inset

 above, it is easy to guess the correct canonical coordinates.
 Consider another example, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\boldsymbol{B}=\textrm{d}y_{1}\wedge\textrm{d}y_{2}+y_{1}\textrm{d}y_{1}\wedge\textrm{d}y_{3}.\]

\end_inset

In this case, it is not obvious how to find suitable canonical coordinates
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},...\right\} $
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{B}$
\end_inset

 is expressed as in Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:omega decomposition}

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To determine the rank of a given closed 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

, the following trick can be used.
 One considers exterior powers of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

, denoted
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Omega^{\wedge k}=\underbrace{\Omega\wedge...\wedge\Omega}_{k\:\text{times}}.\]

\end_inset

Note that for a 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 the product 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega\wedge\Omega$
\end_inset

 does not necessarily vanish.
 A sufficiently high power of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 will, of course, vanish.
 So there will be some number 
\begin_inset Formula $k\leq n/2$
\end_inset

 such that
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\Omega^{\wedge k}\neq0,\quad\Omega^{\wedge(k+1)}=0.\label{eq:Omega power cond}\end{equation}

\end_inset

From the Darboux theorem we know that the decomposition\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:omega decomposition}

\end_inset

) is possible in some coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 In these coordinates, we can compute 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Omega^{\wedge k}=k!\,\textrm{d}x_{1}\wedge...\wedge\textrm{d}x_{2k}\neq0,\]

\end_inset

since by assumption all 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 are independent coordinates in a local coordinate system.
 However, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega^{\wedge(k+1)}=0$
\end_inset

.
 Thus the rank of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $2k$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is the largest integer such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega^{\wedge k}\neq0$
\end_inset

 but 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega^{\wedge(k+1)}=0$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega=0$
\end_inset

, we say that its rank is zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, we can immediately see that the 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{B}$
\end_inset

 specified above has rank 2 because 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{B}\wedge\boldsymbol{B}=0$
\end_inset

Suppose a vector

\begin_inset Formula $\iota_{\mathbf{x}}\Omega=0$

 We would like to prove that

 It follows from

 that
\begin_inset Formula \[

The

\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$

 is proportional to the volume form 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}x_{1}\wedge...\wedge\textrm{d}x_{2k}$

 It follows that
\begin_inset Formula \[
\iota_{\mathbf{x}}\left(\textrm{d}x_{1}\wedge...\wedge\textrm{d}x_{2k}\right)=0.\]

Writing

\begin_layout Paragraph
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The choice of a cnonical basis for an antisymmetric bilinear form 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 is a standard task of finite-dimensional linear algebra.
 We consider an 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-dimensional vector space.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $B=0$
\end_inset

, the rank is zero and the statement is proved.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $B\neq0$
\end_inset

, there exists a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

 such that the 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\iota_{\mathbf{e}_{1}}B$
\end_inset

 is nonzero.
 Thus there exists another vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{2}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $B(\mathbf{e}_{1},\mathbf{e}_{2})=1$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 is antisymmetric, the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{2}$
\end_inset

 cannot be parallel to each other, thus they can be completed to a basis
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},\mathbf{e}_{2},\mathbf{e}_{3},...,\mathbf{e}_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 We can choose the other basis vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{3}$
\end_inset

, ..., 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{n}$
\end_inset

 such that they are orthogonal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{2}$
\end_inset

 with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

, i.e.
\begin_inset Formula \[
B(\mathbf{e}_{1},\mathbf{e}_{j})=B(\mathbf{e}_{2},\mathbf{e}_{j})=0,\quad j=3,...,n.\]

\end_inset

This choice is always possible because we may add to each 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{j}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $j=3,...,n$
\end_inset

 a suitable linear combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{2}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tilde{\mathbf{e}}_{j}=\mathbf{e}_{j}-B(\mathbf{e}_{1},\mathbf{e}_{j})\mathbf{e}_{2}+B(\mathbf{e}_{2},\mathbf{e}_{j})\mathbf{e}_{1},\]

\end_inset

so that now 
\begin_inset Formula $B(\mathbf{e}_{1},\tilde{\mathbf{e}}_{j})=B(\mathbf{e}_{2},\tilde{\mathbf{e}}_{j})=0$
\end_inset

 for every 
\begin_inset Formula $j=3,...,n$
\end_inset

.
 For brevity, let us denote the resulting basis again by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 The result of this construction is that the two subspaces spanned by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},\mathbf{e}_{2}\right\} $
\end_inset

 and by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{3},...,\mathbf{e}_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 are orthogonal to each other with respect to the bilinear form 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After choosing the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},...,\mathbf{e}_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 in this way, we compute the dual basis 1-forms 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \theta_{1},...,\theta_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 for the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},...,\mathbf{e}_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 and represent the 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula \[
B=\theta_{1}\wedge\theta_{2}+B^{(1)},\]

\end_inset

where the new 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $B^{(1)}$
\end_inset

 is equal to zero on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1},\mathbf{e}_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, it is sufficient to consider the 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $B^{(1)}$
\end_inset

 within the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(n-2\right)$
\end_inset

-dimensional subspace spanned by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{3},...,\mathbf{e}_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 We can now apply the same construction to 
\begin_inset Formula $B^{(1)}$
\end_inset

 in a smaller number of dimensions; either 
\begin_inset Formula $B^{(1)}=0$
\end_inset

, or we can find 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{3}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{4}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $B^{(1)}=\theta_{3}\wedge\theta_{4}+B^{(2)}$
\end_inset

, etc.
 The construction eventually stops because at every step the dimensionality
 of the space is reduced by two.
 At that point, we will obtain a decomposition of the form\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:B theta decomp}

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{j}$

The difference between the algebraic and the differential-geometric versions
 of the Darboux theorem is the following.
 According to the algebraic theorem just proved, one may reduce any 2-form
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 to a canonical decomposition at any one point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 This decomposition will involve a certain choice of the 1-forms 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\left.\theta_{j}\right|_{p}\}$
\end_inset

 at each 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 However, this procedure will generally generate different sets 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\left.\theta_{j}\right|_{p}\}$
\end_inset

 in tangent spaces at different points 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

, so there will be no local coordinate system 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x_{j}\right\} $

 in which the 1-forms 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{j}$
\end_inset

 are equal to the coordinate 1-forms 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}x_{j}$
\end_inset

 at every point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 Using the algebraic version of the Darboux theorem, one could obtain the
 decomposition\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:omega decomposition}

\begin_inset Formula $p$

 but not at neighboring points.
 The differential-geometric Darboux theorem says that one can actually choose
 a local coordinate system in which the 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$

\begin_inset Formula \[

\end_inset

in a suitable local coordinate system.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This theorem is proved in three steps.
 The first step is to show that there exists a local coordinate system 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x_{1},...,x_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 depends 
\emph on
only
\emph default
 on the first 
\begin_inset Formula $2k$
\end_inset

 coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x_{1},...,x_{2k}\right\} $
\end_inset

, i.e.
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Omega=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j=1}^{2k}\Omega_{ij}(x_{1},...,x_{2k})\textrm{d}x_{i}\wedge\textrm{d}x_{j}.\]

\end_inset

Then it is sufficient to consider the 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 on a 
\begin_inset Formula $2k$
\end_inset

-dimensional submanifold where the remaining coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x_{2k+1},...,x_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 have fixed values.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first step can be proved as follows.
 If a 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega\neq0$
\end_inset

 has rank 
\begin_inset Formula $2k<n$
\end_inset

 then, by Statement\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{par:Statement-:Darboux-finite-dim}

\end_inset

, at every point there exists a decomposition of the form\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:B theta decomp}

\end_inset

).
 It follows that in the tangent space at every point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

, there will exist a nonempty subspace of vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\iota_{\mathbf{v}}\Omega=0$
\end_inset

.
 Since the 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 is smooth, this subspace will also vary smoothly between points.
 So at least one smooth vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\neq0$
\end_inset

 can be chosen such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\iota_{\mathbf{v}}\Omega=0$
\end_inset

 at every point within some domain.
 A local coordinate system 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x_{1},...,x_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 can be chosen such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}=\partial/\partial x_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Then the property 
\begin_inset Formula $\iota_{\mathbf{v}}\Omega=0$
\end_inset

 means that the expression for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 may contain 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}x_{1}$
\end_inset

, ..., 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}x_{n-1}$
\end_inset

 but no 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}x_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Further, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\Omega=0$
\end_inset

 and thus (by the Cartan homotopy formula)
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{v}}\Omega=\left(\textrm{d}\iota_{\mathbf{v}}+\iota_{\mathbf{v}}\textrm{d}\right)\Omega=0.\]

\end_inset

 The property 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{v}}\Omega=0$
\end_inset

 means that the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{ij}(x_{1},...,x_{n})$
\end_inset

 in the decomposition\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Omega decomposition general}

\end_inset

) do not actually depend on the coordinate 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{n}$
\end_inset

 (see Statement\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{par:Statement-:Lie-derivative-constant-coefficients}

\end_inset

).
 Thus, it is sufficient to study the restriction of the 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 to an 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(n-1\right)$
\end_inset

-dimensional submanifold of constant 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 The same construction can be applied to the reduced 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

.
 If the rank of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 is smaller than 
\begin_inset Formula $n-1$
\end_inset

, anther coordinate 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{n-1}$
\end_inset

 can be found such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 does not indolve 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}x_{n-1}$
\end_inset

 and the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{ij}$
\end_inset

 do not depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{n-1}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus we will reduce 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 to an 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(n-2\right)$
\end_inset

-dimensional manifold, etc.
 Each time, the dimension of the manifold is reduced by one, until we obtain
 a 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 of rank 
\begin_inset Formula $2k$
\end_inset

 on a 
\begin_inset Formula $2k$
\end_inset

-dimensional manifold, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
a 2-form of maximal rank.
 A 2-form of maximal rank is nondegenerate (Statement\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{par:Statement-:maximal-rank-nondegenerate}

\end_inset

).
 Thus it is sufficient to prove the Darboux theorem only for nondegenerate
 2-forms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second step is to prove that there exists a local coordinate system
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x_{1},...,x_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 such that a given closed, nondegenerate 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 has 
\emph on
constant
\emph default
 coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{ij}$
\end_inset

 in the coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Omega=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j=1}^{2n}\Omega_{ij}^{(0)}\textrm{d}x_{i}\wedge\textrm{d}x_{j},\quad\Omega_{ij}^{(0)}=-\Omega_{ij}^{(0)}=\textrm{const}.\]

\end_inset

This involves a differential-geometric argument detailed below.
 The third step is to reduce the nondegenerate, antisymmetric 
\begin_inset Formula $2n\times2n$
\end_inset

 matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{ij}^{(0)}$
\end_inset

 to the canonical form
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\begin{array}{ccccc}
0 & 1\\
-1 & 0 &  & 0\\
 &  & \ddots\\
 & 0 &  & 0 & 1\\
 &  &  & -1 & 0\end{array}\right).\]

\end_inset

 The reduction is performed through a change of basis.
 According to Statement\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{par:Statement-:Darboux-finite-dim}

\end_inset

, a basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},...,\mathbf{e}_{2n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 can be chosen such that the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{ij}^{(0)}$
\end_inset

 assumes the canonical form shown above (there is no zero block since 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{ij}^{(0)}$
\end_inset

 has maximal rank).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It remains to perform the second step.
 We fix a point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 at which 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left.\Omega\right|_{p}=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j=1}^{2n}\Omega_{ij}^{(0)}\textrm{d}x_{i}\wedge\textrm{d}x_{j},\]

\end_inset

and define a new 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{0}$
\end_inset

 at all other points by the formula
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Omega_{0}=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j=1}^{2n}\Omega_{ij}^{(0)}\textrm{d}x_{i}\wedge\textrm{d}x_{j}.\]

\end_inset

By construction, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega=\Omega_{0}$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $p$

\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{0}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Now we would like to find a change of coordinates in a neighborhood of
 
\begin_inset Formula $p$

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$

\begin_inset Formula $f(p)=p$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\Omega)=\Omega_{0}$

\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 The first trick is to write such an interpolation explicitly, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
we define
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Omega_{t}\equiv\Omega+t\left(\Omega_{0}-\Omega\right).\]

\end_inset

The 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{0}-\Omega$
\end_inset

 is closed and thus, by the Poincar lemma, there exists a 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 such that
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Omega_{0}-\Omega=\textrm{d}\theta\]

\end_inset

(perhaps, the above will hold only in a smaller star-shaped neighborhood
 of the initial point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

).
 The second trick is to describe the flow 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{t}$
\end_inset

 through a tangent vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 The vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{t}$
\end_inset

 will be obtained by the duality map from the 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

, using the 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{t}$
\end_inset

 as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

metric.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Converting a 1-form into a vector field is possible only if 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{t}$
\end_inset

 is nondegenerate at every point and for every 
\begin_inset Formula $t\in[0,1]$
\end_inset

.
 We postpone the proof of the nondegeneracy of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{t}$
\end_inset

, and presently we assume that we have a vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{t}$
\end_inset

 satisfying
\begin_inset Formula \[
\iota_{\mathbf{v}_{t}}\Omega_{t}=\theta,\quad t\in\left[0,1\right].\]

\end_inset

We now define the flow 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{t}$
\end_inset

 as the flow generated by the (time-dependent!) vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 By construction, the flow 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{t}$
\end_inset

 transforms 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 into a 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

-dependent 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega(t)$
\end_inset

 which satisfies the differential equation
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{d}{dt}\Omega(t)=\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{v}_{t}}\Omega(t).\]

\end_inset

It is then straightforward to verify that the interpolation 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{t}$
\end_inset

 satisfies this equation:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\frac{d}{dt}\Omega_{t} & =\Omega_{0}-\Omega=\textrm{d}\theta,\\
\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{v}_{t}}\Omega_{t} & =\left(\textrm{d}\iota_{\mathbf{v}_{t}}+\iota_{\mathbf{v}_{t}}\textrm{d}\right)\Omega_{t}=\textrm{d}\iota_{\mathbf{v}_{t}}\Omega_{t}=\textrm{d}\theta.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{t}=\Omega(t)$
\end_inset

 and is indeed the result of the transformation of the initial 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 by the flow 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 The diffeomorphism 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{1}$
\end_inset

 corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $t=1$
\end_inset

 is the one that transforms 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 into 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It remains to demonstrate that the 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{t}$
\end_inset

 has maximal rank for every 
\begin_inset Formula $t\in[0,1]$
\end_inset

 and at every point within some domain.
 We note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{t}$
\end_inset

 interpolates between 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{0}$
\end_inset

, while the 2-forms 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{0}$
\end_inset

 coincide at the chosen point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{t}=\Omega$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

, it is clear that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{t}$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 remains nondegenerate for all 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

; the present task is to show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{t}$
\end_inset

 has maximal rank everywhere in some open domain around 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 The 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{t}$
\end_inset

 has maximal rank 
\begin_inset Formula $2n$
\end_inset

 iff 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{t}^{\wedge n}\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $2n$
\end_inset

-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{t}^{\wedge n}$
\end_inset

 is proportional to the volume form 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}x_{1}\wedge...\wedge\textrm{d}x_{2n}$
\end_inset

, namely
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Omega_{t}^{\wedge n}=f_{t}(x)\,\textrm{d}x_{1}\wedge...\wedge\textrm{d}x_{2n},\]

\end_inset

where the coefficient, temporarily denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{t}$
\end_inset

, is a function of the coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 The rank of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{t}$
\end_inset

 is maximal if 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{t}(x)\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 We know that 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{t}(p)\neq0$
\end_inset

 for every 
\begin_inset Formula $t\in[0,1]$
\end_inset

.
 Since the function 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{t}$
\end_inset

 is smooth, the domain where 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{t}\neq0$
\end_inset

 is a 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

-dependent open set containing the point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 The intersection of all such domains for every 
\begin_inset Formula $t\in[0,1]$
\end_inset

 is again a nonempty open set (possibly smaller than the set where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 has maximal rank).
 Thus, we have found an open domain containing the initial point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{t}$
\end_inset

 is nondegenerate at every 
\begin_inset Formula $t$

\begin_layout Paragraph
Canonical decomposition of 1-forms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The concepts of rank and canonical coordinates can be defined also for 1-forms.
 Heuristically, the rank of a 1-form is the smallest number of independent
 coordinates required to express this 1-form.
 This time, we do not limit ourselves to considering only closed 1-forms;
 but let us briefly examine the case of a closed 1-form.
 By the Poincar lemma, a closed 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 is locally represented as 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega=\textrm{d}f$
\end_inset

 using some function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

.
 The function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 will be nonconstant if 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 can be used as one of the coordinates in a local coordinate system; so
 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 can be expressed using just one coordinate.
 We conclude that a closed, nonzero 1-form has rank 1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Below we will prove that any 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 can be expressed (using suitable local coordinates) in one of two canonical
 ways: either
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\omega=x_{1}\textrm{d}x_{2}+...+x_{2k-1}\textrm{d}x_{2k}\label{eq:omega decomp 1}\end{equation}

\end_inset

(then we say that 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 has rank 
\begin_inset Formula $2k$
\end_inset

), or
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\omega=x_{1}\textrm{d}x_{2}+...+x_{2k-1}\textrm{d}x_{2k}+\textrm{d}x_{2k+1}\label{eq:omega decomp 2}\end{equation}

\end_inset

(then 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 has rank 
\begin_inset Formula $2k+1$
\end_inset

).
 We may call the coordinates used for such decompositions 
\series bold
canonical coordinates
\series default
 of a given 1-form.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Knowing that this statement is true, how could we determine the rank of
 a given 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

, for example,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\omega=\textrm{d}x+xy\textrm{d}z,\]

\end_inset

without knowing the canonical coordinates? We use the following trick.
 Consider the 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\omega$
\end_inset

 and compute its exterior powers, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\textrm{d}\omega\right)^{\wedge k}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1,2,..$
\end_inset

.
 Write the following sequence of the differential forms,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\omega,\:\textrm{d}\omega,\:\omega\wedge\textrm{d}\omega,\:\textrm{d}\omega\wedge\textrm{d}\omega,\:\omega\wedge\textrm{d}\omega\wedge\textrm{d}\omega,\:...\label{eq:omega sequence cond}\end{equation}

\end_inset

The 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-th element of this sequence (
\begin_inset Formula $k=1,2,...$
\end_inset

) is a 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-form.
 Eventually some element of this sequence will be zero, and then all the
 subsequent elements will also be zero.
 By substituting the decompositions\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:omega decomp 1}

\end_inset

) and (
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:omega decomp 2}

\end_inset

) into the sequence\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:omega sequence cond}

\end_inset

), one finds that the rank of 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 is equal to the number of initial nonzero elements in the sequence.
 The rank of 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 is zero if 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega=0$
\end_inset

; the rank of 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 is one if 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\neq0$
\end_inset

 but 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\omega=0$
\end_inset

; the rank of 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 is two if 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\omega\neq0$
\end_inset

 but 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\wedge\textrm{d}\omega=0$
\end_inset

; etc.
 In this way it is straightforward to compute the rank of a 1-form given
 in some local coordinates.
 For example, the rank of 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega=\textrm{d}x+xy\textrm{d}z$
\end_inset

 is 3 (at points where 
\begin_inset Formula $xy\neq0$
\end_inset

) because 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\omega\wedge\textrm{d}\omega=x\textrm{d}x\wedge\textrm{d}y\wedge\textrm{d}z\neq0,\quad\textrm{d}\omega\wedge\textrm{d}\omega=0.\]

Proof of the canonical decomposition theorem for 1-forms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The canonical decomposition theorem for 1-forms states that for any 1-form
 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

, one can choose a local coordinate system 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 is locally represented in one of the two ways, (
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:omega decomp 1}

\end_inset

) or (
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:omega decomp 2}

\end_inset

), as long as 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 has a locally constant rank.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We prove this theorem by reducing it to the Darboux theorem.
 First, we determine the rank of a given 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 by using the sequence\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:omega sequence cond}

\end_inset

).
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 has an odd rank 
\begin_inset Formula $2k+1$
\end_inset

, the 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\omega$
\end_inset

 has rank 
\begin_inset Formula $2k$
\end_inset

 (according to the definition of rank for closed 2-forms) because 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\textrm{d}\omega\right)^{\wedge k}\neq0$
\end_inset

 while 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\textrm{d}\omega\right)^{\wedge(k+1)}=0$
\end_inset

.
 According to the Darboux theorem, we can then choose local coordinages
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{d}\omega=\textrm{d}x_{1}\wedge\textrm{d}x_{2}+...+\textrm{d}x_{2k-1}\wedge\textrm{d}x_{2k}.\]

\end_inset

Applying the Poincar lemma to the closed 1-form
\begin_inset Formula \[
\omega-x_{1}\textrm{d}x_{2}+...+x_{2k-1}\textrm{d}x_{2k},\]

\end_inset

we show that there exists a function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 such that
\begin_inset Formula \[
\omega=\textrm{d}f+x_{1}\textrm{d}x_{2}+...+x_{2k-1}\textrm{d}x_{2k}.\]

\end_inset

Since the 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 has rank 
\begin_inset Formula $2k+1$
\end_inset

, we obtain
\begin_inset Formula \[
0\neq\omega\wedge\left(\textrm{d}\omega\right)^{\wedge k}=\textrm{d}f\wedge k!\,\textrm{d}x_{1}\wedge...\wedge\textrm{d}x_{2k}.\]

\end_inset

Hence, the function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 can be used as a local coordinate that is independent of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x_{1},...,x_{2k}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 Denote this function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2k+1}$
\end_inset

, we obtain the decomposition\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:omega decomp 2}

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the second case, the 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 has an even rank 
\begin_inset Formula $2k$
\end_inset

.
 Then the 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\omega$
\end_inset

 again has rank 
\begin_inset Formula $2k$
\end_inset

, and so we could again arrive at Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:omega decomp 2}

\end_inset

), but we would like to eliminate the last term in that equation.
 So we need to work a little harder.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idea is to find a function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 such that the 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $f\omega$
\end_inset

 has rank 
\begin_inset Formula $2k-1$
\end_inset

.
 If such 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is found, then by the previously proved case it will follow that
\begin_inset Formula \[
f\omega=x_{1}\wedge\textrm{d}x_{2}+...+x_{2k-3}\wedge\textrm{d}x_{2k-2}+\textrm{d}x_{2k-1},\]

\end_inset

so we will obtain
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
\omega & =\frac{1}{f}\left(x_{1}\textrm{d}x_{2}+...+x_{2k-3}\textrm{d}x_{2k-2}+\textrm{d}x_{2k-1}\right)\nonumber \\
 & =y_{1}\textrm{d}y_{2}+...+y_{2k-3}\textrm{d}y_{2k-2}+y_{2k-1}\textrm{d}y_{2k},\label{eq:omega desired}\end{align}

\end_inset

where we simply relabeled the coordinates as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
y_{1}\equiv\frac{1}{f}x_{1},\: y_{2}\equiv x_{2},...,\: y_{2k-1}\equiv\frac{1}{f},\: y_{2k}\equiv x_{2k-1}.\end{equation}

\end_inset

By assumption, the 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 has rank 
\begin_inset Formula $2k$
\end_inset

 and thus
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\textrm{d}\omega\right)^{\wedge k}\neq0,\quad\omega\wedge\left(\textrm{d}\omega\right)^{\wedge k}=0.\]

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\textrm{d}\omega\right)^{\wedge k}\neq0$
\end_inset

, it will follow from Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:omega desired}

\end_inset

) that all 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ y_{1},...,y_{2k}\right\} $
\end_inset

 are independent local coordinates, and thus a decomposition of the form\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:omega decomp 1}

\end_inset

) will be found.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It remains to determine 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 such that the 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $f\omega$
\end_inset

 has rank 
\begin_inset Formula $2k-1$
\end_inset

.
 It is sufficient to find some function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
0 & =\left(\textrm{d}(f\omega)\right)^{\wedge k}=\left(\textrm{d}f\wedge\omega+f\textrm{d}\omega\right)^{\wedge k}\\
 & =kf^{k-1}\textrm{d}f\wedge\omega\wedge\left(\textrm{d}\omega\right)^{\wedge(k-1)}+f^{k}\left(\textrm{d}\omega\right)^{\wedge k}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Thus the function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 must satisfy the differential equation
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left(\textrm{d}\ln f\right)\wedge\omega\wedge\left(\textrm{d}\omega\right)^{\wedge(k-1)}=-\frac{1}{k}\left(\textrm{d}\omega\right)^{\wedge k}.\label{eq:equation for f}\end{equation}

\end_inset

To solve this equation for 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 (or rather, to show that a solution exists), we need to use some additional
 information about 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

.
 We know that the 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\omega$
\end_inset

 has rank 
\begin_inset Formula $2k$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, by the Darboux theorem we may choose local coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x_{1},...,x_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{d}\omega=\textrm{d}x_{1}\wedge\textrm{d}x_{2}+...+\textrm{d}x_{2k-1}\wedge\textrm{d}x_{2k}.\]

\end_inset

Applying the Poincar lemma to the closed 1-form
\begin_inset Formula \[
\omega-x_{1}\textrm{d}x_{2}+...+x_{2k-1}\textrm{d}x_{2k},\]

\end_inset

we show that there exists a function 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 such that
\begin_inset Formula \[
\omega=\textrm{d}h+x_{1}\textrm{d}x_{2}+...+x_{2k-1}\textrm{d}x_{2k}.\]

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\omega$
\end_inset

 has rank 
\begin_inset Formula $2k$
\end_inset

, we have
\begin_inset Formula \[
0=\left(\textrm{d}\omega\right)^{\wedge(k+1)}=\left(k+1\right)!\,\textrm{d}h\wedge\textrm{d}x_{1}\wedge...\wedge\textrm{d}x_{2k},\]

\end_inset

so the function 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 can depend only on the subset of coordinates consisting of the first 
\begin_inset Formula $2k$
\end_inset

 coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x_{1},...,x_{2k}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 Hence the 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 depends also only on these coordinates.
 Let us write
\begin_inset Formula \[
\omega=\sum_{j=1}^{2k}a_{j}\textrm{d}x_{j},\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{j}$
\end_inset

 are coefficients that depend only on 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x_{1},...,x_{2k}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 Since both parts of Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:equation for f}

\end_inset

) depend only on these coordinates, the function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is a function only of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x_{1},...,x_{2k}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can now return to the task of determining a suitable function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

.
 First we express the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(2k-1\right)$
\end_inset

-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\wedge\left(\textrm{d}\omega\right)^{\wedge(k-1)}$
\end_inset

 needed for Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:equation for f}

\end_inset

) as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
 & \omega\wedge\left(\textrm{d}\omega\right)^{\wedge(k-1)}\\
 & =\left(k-1\right)!\left(a_{1}\textrm{d}x_{1}+a_{2}\textrm{d}x_{2}\right)\wedge\textrm{d}x_{3}\wedge...\wedge\textrm{d}x_{2k}+...\\
 & +\left(k-1\right)!\left(a_{2k-1}\textrm{d}x_{2k-1}+a_{2k}\textrm{d}x_{2k}\right)\wedge\textrm{d}x_{1}\wedge...\wedge\textrm{d}x_{2k-2}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

The unknown 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\ln f$
\end_inset

 can then be written as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{d}\ln f\equiv\sum_{j=1}^{2k}l_{j}\textrm{d}x_{j},\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{j}$
\end_inset

 are unknown coefficients depending on 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x_{1},...,x_{2k}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 Using this explicit representation, we compute
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\left(\textrm{d}\ln f\right)\wedge\omega\wedge\left(\textrm{d}\omega\right)^{\wedge(k-1)}=\left(k-1\right)! & \left(a_{1}l_{2}-a_{2}l_{1}+...\right.\\
\left.+a_{2k-1}l_{2k}-a_{2k}l_{2k-1}\right) & \textrm{d}x_{1}\wedge...\textrm{d}x_{2k}\end{align*}

\end_inset

 and hence is proportional to the 
\begin_inset Formula $2k$
\end_inset

-dimensional volume form
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\textrm{d}\omega\right)^{\wedge k}=k!\,\textrm{d}x_{1}\wedge...\textrm{d}x_{2k}.\]

\end_inset

 It is convenient to introduce an auxiliary vector field
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{v}\equiv-a_{2}\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{1}}+a_{1}\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{2}}-...-a_{2k}\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{2k-1}}+a_{2k-1}\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{2k}}\]

\end_inset

and write
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left(\textrm{d}\ln f\right)\wedge\omega\wedge\left(\textrm{d}\omega\right)^{\wedge(k-1)}=\left(k-1\right)!\left(\iota_{\mathbf{v}}\textrm{d}\ln f\right)\textrm{d}x_{1}\wedge...\textrm{d}x_{2k}.\end{equation}

\end_inset

Since both sides of Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:equation for f}

\end_inset

) are proportional to the volume form, the equation is simplified to
\begin_inset Formula \[
\iota_{\mathbf{v}}\textrm{d}\ln f=\mathbf{v}\circ\ln f=-1.\]

\end_inset

Note that the field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 can be also defined without coordinates by the requirement
\begin_inset Formula \[
\iota_{\mathbf{v}}\left[\omega\wedge\left(\textrm{d}\omega\right)^{\wedge(k-1)}\right]=0.\]

\end_inset

In other words, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is a vector field that annihilates the nonzero 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(2k-1\right)$
\end_inset

-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\wedge\left(\textrm{d}\omega\right)^{\wedge(k-1)}$
\end_inset

.
 (In general, a 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-form vanishes on an 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(n-k\right)$
\end_inset

-dimensional hypersurface, so a 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(2k-1\right)$
\end_inset

-form vanishes on a 1-dimensional subspace.
 The vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is a basis vector in that subspace.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We found that only restriction on the function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is that its logarithmic derivative in the direction of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 must equal 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

.
 Now it is clear that a solution 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 exists (at least locally).
 A particular solution 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 can be determined by integration along the orbits of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 from arbitrary initial conditions.
 This completes the proof.

\begin_inset Formula $\omega$

\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}$
\end_inset

's.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The integral 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\mathcal{A}}\omega$
\end_inset

 is defined by the following procedure.
 One starts by splitting the manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}$
\end_inset

 into a large number 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 of small 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-dimensional paralellepipeds.
 If all the parallelepipeds are sufficiently small, one can approximate
 the sides of parallelepipeds by tangent vectors (see Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Short-curve-segments}

\end_inset

).
 Thus, to each parallelepiped numbered 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $j=1,...,N$
\end_inset

) there corresponds a set of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 tangent vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\mathbf{v}_{1}^{(j)},...,\mathbf{v}_{n}^{(j)}\}$
\end_inset

.
 The parallelepiped numbered 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 contributes a small amount to the integral; this amount is equal to some
 number (the value of the function being integrated) times the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-dimensional volume of the parallelepiped.
 It is natural to regard the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-volume of a parallelepiped spanned by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{1},...,\mathbf{v}_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 as an 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-form evaluated on the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{i}\right\} $
\end_inset

 (see Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Volume-as-antisymmetric}

\end_inset

).
 So the contribution of the 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

-th parallelepiped to the integral can be naturally described as an application
 of some 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-form to the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\mathbf{v}_{1}^{(j)},...,\mathbf{v}_{n}^{(j)}\}$
\end_inset

.
 In the integral we are evaluating, this 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-form is the given 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, to define the integral 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\mathcal{A}}\omega$
\end_inset

 we evaluate the contribution 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\circ(\mathbf{v}_{1}^{(j)},...,\mathbf{v}_{n}^{(j)})$
\end_inset

 of each parallelepiped 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 and then compute the sum of the contributions over all the parallelepipeds.
 Thus, the integral 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\mathcal{A}}\omega$
\end_inset

 is defined as the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $N\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

 of that sum,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int_{\mathcal{A}}\omega\equiv\lim_{N\rightarrow\infty}\sum_{j=1}^{N}\omega\circ(\mathbf{v}_{1}^{(j)},...,\mathbf{v}_{n}^{(j)}).\]

\end_inset

 This limit is quite similar to the limit involved in the ordinary definition
 of the Riemann integral.
 So integrals of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-forms are equivalent to 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-fold integrals in the usual sense.
 However, an important caveat is that integrals of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-forms are always performed over 
\emph on
oriented
\emph default
 manifolds.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-forms are antisymmetric, an integral will change sign when the orientation
 of the manifold is reversed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fundamental relationship between integration and the exterior differential

\text{Distance}\left(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\right)=\sqrt{\left(b_{1}-a_{1}\right)^{2}+...+\left(b_{n}-a_{n}\right)^{2}},\label{eq:Euclidean distance}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{n}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{n}$
\end_inset

 are standard coordinates (components) of the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 Let us now consider a surface 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 embedded into 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

.
 We would like to compute the distance between two points 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\in\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

, as measured along some path 
\emph on
within the surface
\emph default
.
 However, if the surface has a curved shape then one does not have a simple
 and general formula analogous to Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(

) for distances measured 
\emph on

\emph default
 
\emph on

 Nevertheless, if two points 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$

 connecting these points.
 The length of this curve segment can be accurately estimated using the
 Euclidean formula\InsetSpace ~

 Then the length of any curve within the surface can be determined by splitting
 the curve into sufficiently small segments.
 More precisely, one can integrate the

\begin_layout Standard
Let us explore this idea in more detail.
 To be specific, let us consider a two-dimensional manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 embedded in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

 as a surface 
\begin_inset Formula $z=F(x,y)$
\end_inset

 in standard coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x,y,z\right\} $
\end_inset

, as shown in Fig.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:A-metric}

\end_inset

.
 We are interested in computing the length of a curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)\subset\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

.
 The curve is specified by three functions 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x(\tau),y(\tau),z(\tau)\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 Consider a very short curve segment between 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=\tau_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=\tau_{0}+\delta\tau$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\tau$
\end_inset

 is very small.
 This segment is an almost straight line between the nearby points 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x_{0},y_{0},z_{0}\right\} \equiv\left\{ x(\tau_{0}),y(\tau_{0}),z(\tau_{0})\right\} $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x_{1},y_{1},z_{1}\right\} \equiv\left\{ x(\tau_{0}+\delta\tau),y(\tau_{0}+\delta\tau),z(\tau_{0}+\delta\tau)\right\} $
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

.
 So we may compute the length 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta L$
\end_inset

 of the segment approximately as the Euclidean distance between these points,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\delta L\approx\sqrt{\left(x_{1}-x_{0}\right)^{2}+\left(y_{1}-y_{0}\right)^{2}+\left(z_{1}-z_{0}\right)^{2}}.\]

\end_inset

Further, we may approximate 
\begin_inset Formula \[
x_{1}-x_{0}=x(\tau_{0}+\delta\tau)-x(\tau_{0})\approx\delta\tau\frac{dx}{d\tau}(\tau_{0}),\quad\textrm{etc.},\]

\end_inset

and hence
\begin_inset Formula \[
\delta L\approx\delta\tau\sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{d\tau}(\tau_{0})\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{dy}{d\tau}(\tau_{0})\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{dz}{d\tau}(\tau_{0})\right)^{2}}.\]

\end_inset

In the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\tau\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

, this expression becomes precise since the error is of order 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\tau^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 So the length of the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)$
\end_inset

 between 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=\tau_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=\tau_{1}$
\end_inset

 can be found as an integral over the infinitesimal curve segments,
\begin_inset Formula \[
L\left[\gamma\right]=\int_{\tau_{0}}^{\tau_{1}}d\tau\sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{d\tau}(\tau)\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{dy}{d\tau}(\tau)\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{dz}{d\tau}(\tau)\right)^{2}}.\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So far we have used all three coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $x,y,z$
\end_inset

 to describe the curve.
 However, the pair 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x,y\right\} $
\end_inset

 can be used as local coordinates on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

, and so we would like to be able to compute lengths of curves without using
 the coordinate 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, we would like to use only an intrinsic description of the
 manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

metric
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is the structure representing the information necessary for computing lengths
 in the intrinsic description.
 Let us now see what that information is in our example.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given the equation 
\begin_inset Formula $z=F(x,y)$
\end_inset

, we may express
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{dz(\tau)}{d\tau}=\frac{\partial F(x,y)}{\partial x}\frac{dx(\tau)}{d\tau}+\frac{\partial F(x,y)}{\partial y}\frac{dy(\tau)}{d\tau},\]

\end_inset

where it is implied that the derivatives of 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 are evaluated on the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, the length 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta L$
\end_inset

 of an infinitesimal curve segment can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
\delta L & =\delta\tau\sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{d\tau}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{dy}{d\tau}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial x}\frac{dx}{d\tau}+\frac{\partial F}{\partial y}\frac{dy}{d\tau}\right)^{2}}\nonumber \\
 & =\delta\tau\sqrt{A\left(\frac{dx}{d\tau}\right)^{2}+2B\frac{dx}{d\tau}\frac{dy}{d\tau}+C\left(\frac{dy}{d\tau}\right)^{2}},\label{eq:delta L quadratic element}\end{align}

\end_inset

where we introduced auxiliary functions 
\begin_inset Formula $A,B,C$
\end_inset

 expressed directly through 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula \[
A(x,y)\equiv1+\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial x}\right)^{2},\quad B\equiv\frac{\partial F}{\partial x}\frac{\partial F}{\partial y},\quad C\equiv1+\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial y}\right)^{2}.\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we note that Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:delta L quadratic element}

\end_inset

) looks like a quadratic form applied to the two-dimensional vector 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}\equiv\left\{ \frac{dx}{d\tau},\frac{dy}{d\tau}\right\} \in T_{\gamma(\tau)}\mathcal{M}.\]

\end_inset

Recalling the correspondence between tangent vectors from 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{p}\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 and short curve segments (see Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Short-curve-segments}

\end_inset

), we can verify that the tangent vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 defined by
\begin_inset Formula \[
\delta\mathbf{v}\equiv\left(\delta\tau\right)\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}=\left(\delta\tau\right)\left[\frac{dx}{d\tau}\partial_{x}+\frac{dy}{d\tau}\partial_{y}\right]\in T_{\gamma(\tau_{0})}\mathcal{M}\]

\end_inset

 is the vector representing the short curve segment between 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau_{0})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau_{0}+\delta\tau)$
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta L$
\end_inset

 can be expressed as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\delta L=\delta\tau\sqrt{g(\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}},\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}})}=\sqrt{g(\delta\mathbf{v},\delta\mathbf{v})},\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is the following bilinear form,
\begin_inset Formula \[
g\equiv A\textrm{d}x\otimes\textrm{d}x+B(\textrm{d}x\otimes\textrm{d}y+\textrm{d}y\otimes\textrm{d}x)+C\textrm{d}y\otimes\textrm{d}y.\]

\end_inset

 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta L$
\end_inset

 (the length of a short curve segment) can be expressed through the bilinear
 form 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 alone, without using any other information (such as the function 
\begin_inset Formula $F(x,y)$
\end_inset

 or the embedding of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 in the Euclidean space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

).
 The length of the curve between 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{1}$
\end_inset

 can be expressed as
\begin_inset Formula \[
L[\gamma]=\int_{\tau_{0}}^{\tau_{1}}d\tau\sqrt{g(\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}},\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}})}.\]

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
In our example, once we computed the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 (which, in a local coordinate system, is equivalent to determining the
 three functions 
\begin_inset Formula $A,B,C$
\end_inset

), we may stop using the embedding of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

 because it is sufficient to use the local coordinate system 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x,y\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 This simplifies the calculations since one needs to work with fewer coordinates
, and also allows one to concentrate on the intrinsic properties of the
 manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 Below we will not use the embedding picture to the metric; instead, we
 will work directly with the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

, assuming that somehow 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is given.
 It will be unimportant whether or not the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 comes from an embedding of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 in a larger Euclidean space.
 An embedding of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 into 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{n}$

 can be regarded as merely an auxiliary construction that helps visualize
 the concept of metric.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In practice, it is sometimes useful to specify the metric on a manifold
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 by selecting a particular embedding of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 into a Euclidean space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

 and declaring that the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 is the natural metric induced by this embedding, through the construction
 of infinitesimal curve segments outlined above.

\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 In the example above, this would mean that we specify the local coordinates

\begin_layout Subsection
Examples of metrics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a first example, consider a flat Minkowski space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}\equiv\mathbb{R}^{4}$
\end_inset

 with standard coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ t,x,y,z\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 The Minkowski metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 can be specified by the following index-free expression,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
g(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}) & =\left(\mathbf{u}\circ t\right)\left(\mathbf{v}\circ t\right)-\left(\mathbf{u}\circ x\right)\left(\mathbf{v}\circ x\right)\\
 & \:-\left(\mathbf{u}\circ y\right)\left(\mathbf{v}\circ y\right)-\left(\mathbf{u}\circ z\right)\left(\mathbf{v}\circ z\right).\end{align*}

\end_inset

In this expression, the coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ t,x,y,z\right\} $
\end_inset

 are interpreted as scalar functions on the manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

, and the vector fields 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 are interpreted as derivative operations applied to these scalar functions.
 We can then directly compute
\begin_inset Formula \[
g(\frac{\partial}{\partial t},\frac{\partial}{\partial t})=1,\quad g(\frac{\partial}{\partial t},\frac{\partial}{\partial x})=0,\quad g(\frac{\partial}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial}{\partial x},\frac{\partial}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial}{\partial x})=0,\]

\end_inset

etc.
 This metric can be also written as
\begin_inset Formula \[
g=\textrm{d}t\otimes\textrm{d}t-\textrm{d}x\otimes\textrm{d}x-\textrm{d}y\otimes\textrm{d}y-\textrm{d}z\otimes\textrm{d}z,\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}t,\textrm{d}x,\textrm{d}y,\textrm{d}z$
\end_inset

 are the 1-forms defined through the coordinate functions 
\begin_inset Formula $t,x,y,z$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Remark on notation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the physics literature, one usually finds the Minkowski metric written
 as follows,
\begin_inset Formula \[
ds^{2}=dt^{2}-dx^{2}-dy^{2}-dz^{2}.\]

\end_inset

Strictly speaking, this notation is inconsistent; for instance, 
\begin_inset Formula $dt^{2}$
\end_inset

 stands for the bilinear form 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}t\otimes\textrm{d}t$
\end_inset

, and yet 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $ds^{2}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cannot be interpreted as 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}s\otimes\textrm{d}s$
\end_inset

 with any 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}s$
\end_inset

.
 Expressions of this kind are understood as being no more than a traditional
 (or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $ds^{2}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is simply a symbol for the bilinear form 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

.
 Also, physicists write 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $dt\, dx"$
\end_inset

 when they need the symmetric tensor product 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}\left(\textrm{d}t\otimes\textrm{d}x+\textrm{d}x\otimes\textrm{d}t\right)$
\end_inset

.
 I will frequently use the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

physicists's
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 metric notation for brevity.
 To call attention to the traditional character of this notation, I will
 denote the metric by 
\begin_inset Formula $g$

\begin_inset Formula $ds^{2}$

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}\left(\textrm{d}t\otimes\textrm{d}x+\textrm{d}x\otimes\textrm{d}t\right)$
\end_inset

 that does not yield any computational advantage.

\begin_layout Standard
In a three-dimensional Euclidean space, the Levi-Civita symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{ijk}$
\end_inset

 is closely related to volume.
 It is known that one can calculate the (oriented) volume of a parallelepiped
 spanned by three vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c}\right\} $
\end_inset

 by using the following explicit formula,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{Vol}\left(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c}\right)=\mathbf{a}\cdot\left(\mathbf{b}\times\mathbf{c}\right)=\sum_{i,j,k}\varepsilon_{ijk}a^{i}b^{j}c^{k},\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $a^{i},b^{j},c^{k}$
\end_inset

 are the Euclidean components of the three vectors (i.e.\InsetSpace ~
components in an orthogona
l basis).
 We have seen in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{par:Oriented volume and n-vectors}

\end_inset

 that the oriented volume of such a parallelepiped is equal to the value
 of a 3-form evaluated on the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, the array of numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{ijk}$
\end_inset

 can be interpreted as the array of components of the 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$
\end_inset

 in the orthogonal basis.
 Then we have
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{Vol}\left(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c}\right)=\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}\circ\left(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c}\right).\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us generalize this construction to a curved, four-dimensional manifold
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$

 In a tangent space at a fixed point 
\begin_inset Formula $p\in\mathcal{M}$

\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\mathbf{v}_{1},\mathbf{v}_{2},\mathbf{v}_{3},\mathbf{v}_{4})$
\end_inset

 is equal to the oriented 4-volume of the parallelepiped spanned by the
 tangent vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{2}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{3}$

\end_inset

 is an orthonormal basis with a

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 orientation then the 4-volume of the parallelepiped spanned by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is equal to 1.
 Thus, we are looking for a 4-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\mathbf{e}_{0},\mathbf{e}_{1},\mathbf{e}_{2},\mathbf{e}_{3})=1.\]

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}\circ\mathbf{e}_{b}=\delta_{b}^{a}$
\end_inset

, it is clear that 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}=\boldsymbol{\theta}^{0}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{1}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{2}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{3}$
\end_inset

 is one such 4-form.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We defined 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$
\end_inset

 through a particular basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

, so we need to investigate whether and to what extent 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$
\end_inset

 depends on the choice of the basis.
 Of course, 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$
\end_inset

 changes sign when the orientation of the basis is reversed.
 It turns out that 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$
\end_inset

 does not actually depend on the choice of the basis, as long as the orientation
 of the basis is fixed (see Statement\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Statement-epsilon-independent-of-basis}

\end_inset

 In particular, the orthonormal frame 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{\alpha}\right\} $
\end_inset

 may be defined only locally, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
different frames 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{\alpha}\right\} $
\end_inset

 need to be used in different parts of the manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$

 Nevertheless, the tensor

\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us consider a linear transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{T}$
\end_inset

 that brings the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

 into another basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \tilde{\mathbf{e}}_{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tilde{\mathbf{e}}_{a}=\hat{T}\mathbf{e}_{a},\quad\tilde{\boldsymbol{\theta}}^{a}=\hat{T}^{-1}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}.\]

\end_inset

By definition of the determinant (see Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Determinants}

\end_inset

), the oriented volume of the parallelepiped spanned by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \tilde{\mathbf{e}}_{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{T}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, if the new basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \tilde{\mathbf{e}}_{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is orthonormal and has the same orientation as the old orthonormal basis,
 the oriented volume of the parallelepiped spanned by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \tilde{\mathbf{e}}_{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is also equal to 1.
 Hence, we must have 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{T}=1$
\end_inset

.
 On the other hand,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tilde{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}\equiv\tilde{\boldsymbol{\theta}}^{0}\wedge\tilde{\boldsymbol{\theta}}^{1}\wedge\tilde{\boldsymbol{\theta}}^{2}\wedge\tilde{\boldsymbol{\theta}}^{3}=(\det\hat{T}^{-1})\boldsymbol{\theta}^{0}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{1}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{2}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{3}=\boldsymbol{\varepsilon},\]

\end_inset

by the same logic as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tilde{\mathbf{e}}_{1}\wedge\tilde{\mathbf{e}}_{2}\wedge\tilde{\mathbf{e}}_{3}\wedge\tilde{\mathbf{e}}_{4}=(\det\hat{T})\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{3}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{4}.\]

\end_inset

Therefore the new 4-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}}$
\end_inset

 defined through the new basis is equal to the old 4-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$

 All 4-forms in four-dimensional space are proportional to each other, so
 the Levi-Civita tensor can be written 
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Standard
s determined by different metrics will be proportional to each other.
 So a formula for 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$
\end_inset

 in terms of the metric can be given by a single scalar function.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We used an orthonormal basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

 of 1-forms to write the 4-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$
\end_inset

, but actually we can use any other basis: since all 4-forms are proportional
 to each other, we only need to include a correct scalar factor.
 So let us use the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \textrm{d}x^{\mu}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 Using this basis, the 4-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$
\end_inset

 can be written 
\end_layout

\end_inset

in a local coordinate system 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x^{\mu}\right\} $

\begin_inset Formula \[
\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}=f\textrm{d}x^{0}\wedge\textrm{d}x^{1}\wedge\textrm{d}x^{2}\wedge\textrm{d}x^{3},\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is some unknown scalar function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It remains to determine the unknown coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

.
 To do that, we can use a suitable modification of Statement\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Statement-volume-of-parallelepiped}

\end_inset

.
 By definition, the matrix elements 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 are equal to scalar products 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\partial_{\mu},\partial_{\nu})$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \partial_{\mu}\right\} \equiv\left\{ \partial/\partial x^{\mu}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a coordinate basis.
 Thus one can show that the 4-volume of the parallelepiped spanned by the
 tangent vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \partial_{\mu}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm\sqrt{\left|\det g_{\mu\nu}\right|}$
\end_inset

.
 The factor 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\pm$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 reflects the fact that the volume is oriented and may be negative if the
 coordinate basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \partial_{\mu}\right\} $
\end_inset

 has a negative orientation.
 The absolute value 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\det g_{\mu\nu}\right|$
\end_inset

 is needed to compensate for the signature of the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

, which might make the determinant negative.
 Thus
\begin_inset Formula \[
f\equiv\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\partial_{0},\partial_{1},\partial_{2},\partial_{3})=\textrm{Vol}(\partial_{0},\partial_{1},\partial_{2},\partial_{3})=\pm\sqrt{\left|\det g_{\mu\nu}\right|}.\]

\end_inset

It is convenient to assume that the coordinate basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \partial_{\mu}\right\} $
\end_inset

 has positive orientation.
 Hence the final formula for 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$
\end_inset

 in local coordinates is
\begin_inset Formula \[
\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}=\sqrt{\left|\det g_{\mu\nu}\right|}\textrm{d}x^{0}\wedge\textrm{d}x^{1}\wedge\textrm{d}x^{2}\wedge\textrm{d}x^{3}.\]

\end_inset

In this way, the functional dependence of 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$
\end_inset

 on the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is made explicit.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is useful to note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}=0$
\end_inset

.
 This is so because 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$
\end_inset

 is a 5-form, and there are no nonzero 5-forms in four-dimensional space.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main use of the Levi-Civita tensor in GR is to compute 4-dimensional
 volume in curved space.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Standard
There are other, more advanced applications of the Levi-Civita tensor, such
 as the Hodge star operation, which I will consider below.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Since the tangent vectors are an approximate representation of short curve
 segments (Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Short-curve-segments}

\end_inset

), the 4-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$
\end_inset

 yields a good approximation to the 4-dimensional volume for very small
 volumes.
 Therefore, one can compute the 4-dimensional volume of a spacetime domain
 by integrating the 4-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$
\end_inset

 over that domain, and one can also integrate scalar functions times 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$
\end_inset

 over a domain.
 The integration is defined purely geometrically, regardless of the choice
 of the coordinate system, once the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is fixed.
 For this reason (independence of coordinates), physicists know the Levi-Civita
 tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$

\begin_inset Formula $T_{p}\mathcal{M}$

 It is clear that the construction of the Levi-Civita tensor can be straightforw

\begin_layout Standard
To formulate the laws of physics, we need to write differential equations
 for some vector and tensor fields on the spacetime manifold.
 These differential equations involve derivatives of these vector or tensor
 fields in various directions.
 Thus we need to have a directional derivative operation that acts on arbitrary
 tensors.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One could think at first that the Lie derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{v}}$

 is to be used as a directional derivative operation.
 However, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{v}}$
\end_inset

 is not a true directional derivative because it depends on the behavior
 of the vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$

\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and not only on the value 
\begin_inset Formula $\left.\mathbf{v}\right|_{p}$

 A true directional derivative of a tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$

\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 must depend 
\emph on
only
\emph default
 on the value 
\begin_inset Formula $\left.\mathbf{v}\right|_{p}$
\end_inset

 at the given point.
 Defining such a true directional derivative requires some information about

 neighbor tangent spaces 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{p}\mathcal{M}$

 If such a

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 points could be subtracted.
 For instance, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left.A\right|_{p'}-\left.A\right|_{p}$

 could be defined as the limit 
\begin_inset Formula \[

 Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left.\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}A\right|_{p}$

 Such a

\begin_inset Formula \[

\end_inset

 is the tangent vector at point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$

 Thus, there are as many connections

 In a local coordinate system, the map

The above properties of the operation

 before the extra index introduced by the covariant derivative.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the index-free notation, we denote the derivative with respect to the

 Thus, the vector

\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x^{\mu}\right\} $
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\partial_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{v}\right)^{\alpha}=u^{\lambda}v_{\;,\lambda}^{\alpha}.\]

 In the coordinate system 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x^{\mu}\right\} $

\begin_inset Formula $\partial$

Hence, for a fixed vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$

 the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}-\partial_{\mathbf{u}}$

 Equivalently, we can say that

To formulate the laws of physics, we need to write differential equations

\begin_inset Formula $\partial$

 in a fixed coordinate system 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x^{\mu}\right\} $

 But the connection 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla\equiv\partial$
\end_inset

 is inconvenient not only because it depends on a fixed coordinate system
 (while the laws of physics are expected to be independent of coordinates),
 but also because it is in general 
\emph on

 in the following sense.

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{v}=0$

 Then it is natural to expect that the length of the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is also constant in the direction of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
that 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})=0$

 However, this property does not necessarily hold, since we will generally
 have
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v}) & =(\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}g)\circ(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})+g(\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})+g(\mathbf{v},\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{v})\\
 & =(\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}g)\circ(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})\neq0.\end{align*}

\end_inset

This inconvenience will be avoided only if 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}g=0$
\end_inset

 for any vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 The property 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla g=0$

An equivalent way to write this property is

\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}

\end_inset

At the moment this property is written using the index notation.
 To reformulate the property\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:derivatives commute}

 Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:derivatives commute}

\begin_inset Formula $u^{\mu}v^{\nu}$

\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
u^{\mu}v^{\nu}\nabla_{\mu}\nabla_{\nu}f & =u^{\mu}\nabla_{\mu}\left(u^{\nu}\nabla_{\nu}f\right)-\left(u^{\mu}\nabla_{\mu}u^{\nu}\right)\left(\nabla_{\nu}f\right)\\
 & =\mathbf{u}\circ(\mathbf{v}\circ f)-\left(\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{v}\right)\circ f.\end{align*}

\end_inset

 Thus, the property\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset Formula \[

\end_inset

It is not necessarily true that an arbitrary connection

\end_inset

which is a vector-valued 2-form (see Statement\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Statement-torsion}

 The property\InsetSpace ~

In General Relativity, this is the connection used to formulate differential
 equations for physical quantities.
 The properties of metricity and torsion-freeness are imposed for several
 reasons, including mathematical simplicity.
 Ultimately, these properties are

Other, more complicated theories of gravity may use non-metric connections,
 e.g.\InsetSpace ~
the Einstein-Cartan theory 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{Einstein-Cartan theory}

admits a connection with nonzero torsion.
 Well...
 do we actually say anything about the EC theory? No.

(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:compatibility with the metric}

 It will follow that such a connection is unique.
 Later we shall see how to describe other connections.

\begin_layout Subsection*
First examples
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before presenting a general derivation, let us make the discussion less
 abstract by considering examples.
 First we verify that the Levi-Civita connection in the Euclidean space
 is just the ordinary, familiar directional derivative.
 Consider the three-dimensional space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

with coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x,y,z\right\} $
\end_inset

 and the metric 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g=dx^{2}+dy^{2}+dz^{2},\]

\end_inset

and let us evaluate some covariant derivatives.
 We will be using only the assumed properties of the Levi-Civita connection
 and see where this will lead us.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose we need to compute the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\partial_{x}}\partial_{x}$
\end_inset

.
 The way to compute it is to evaluate scalar products of this vector with
 other vectors.
 For instance, using the compatibility of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla$
\end_inset

 with the metric, and the properties 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\partial_{x},\partial_{x})=1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\partial_{x},\partial_{y})=0$
\end_inset

 etc., we find
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
g(\nabla_{\partial_{x}}\partial_{x},\partial_{x}) & =\frac{1}{2}g(\nabla_{\partial_{x}}\partial_{x},\partial_{x})+\frac{1}{2}g(\partial_{x},\nabla_{\partial_{x}}\partial_{x})\\
 & =\frac{1}{2}\nabla_{\partial_{x}}g(\partial_{x},\partial_{x})=\frac{1}{2}\partial_{x}\left(1\right)=0.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Using the torsion-freeness and the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\partial_{x},\partial_{y}\right]=0$
\end_inset

, we also find
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
g(\nabla_{\partial_{x}}\partial_{x},\partial_{y}) & =\nabla_{\partial_{x}}g(\partial_{x},\partial_{y})-g(\partial_{x},\nabla_{\partial_{x}}\partial_{y})\\
 & =0-g(\partial_{x},[\partial_{x},\partial_{y}]+\nabla_{\partial_{y}}\partial_{x})\\
 & =-\frac{1}{2}\nabla_{\partial_{y}}g(\partial_{x},\partial_{x})=0.\end{align*}

\end_inset

In this way, it is easy to see that 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\partial_{x}}\partial_{x}$
\end_inset

 has zero scalar products with every basis vector; thus it is itself zero,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\partial_{x}}\partial_{x}=0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us now consider 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\partial_{x}}\partial_{y}$
\end_inset

.
 We have already seen that 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\nabla_{\partial_{x}}\partial_{y},\partial_{x})=0$
\end_inset

, and further we obtain
\begin_inset Formula \[
g(\nabla_{\partial_{x}}\partial_{y},\partial_{y})=\frac{1}{2}\nabla_{\partial_{x}}g(\partial_{y},\partial_{y})=0.\]

\end_inset

The computation of the scalar product 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\nabla_{\partial_{x}}\partial_{y},\partial_{z})$
\end_inset

 is a bit longer.
 First, we find
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
g(\nabla_{\partial_{x}}\partial_{y},\partial_{z}) & =g(\left[\partial_{x},\partial_{y}\right]+\nabla_{\partial_{y}}\partial_{x},\partial_{z})=-g(\partial_{x},\nabla_{\partial_{y}}\partial_{z})\\
 & =-g(\nabla_{\partial_{y}}\partial_{z},\partial_{x}).\end{align*}

\end_inset

The trick is to notice that we now have a similar structure with the coordinates
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x,y,z\right\} $
\end_inset

 cyclically transposed.
 Repeating the transposition twice more, we find
\begin_inset Formula \[
g(\nabla_{\partial_{x}}\partial_{y},\partial_{z})=-g(\nabla_{\partial_{x}}\partial_{y},\partial_{z}),\]

\end_inset

so it vanishes.
 Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\partial_{x}}\partial_{y}=0$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly, one can show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\partial_{x}}\partial_{z}=0$
\end_inset

, etc.
 In other words, in flat space the covariant derivative of every basis vector
 in any direction equals zero.
 Now, we consider an arbitrary vector field 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{v}=A\partial_{x}+B\partial_{y}+C\partial_{z},\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $A,B,C$
\end_inset

 are functions of 
\begin_inset Formula $x,y,z$
\end_inset

.
 We compute
\begin_inset Formula \[
\nabla_{\partial_{x}}\mathbf{v}=\left(\partial_{x}A\right)\partial_{x}+\left(\partial_{x}B\right)\partial_{y}+\left(\partial_{x}C\right)\partial_{z},\]

\end_inset

since the derivatives 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\partial_{x}}$
\end_inset

 of the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{x}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{y}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{z}$
\end_inset

 vanish.
 In other words, the Levi-Civita connection 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\partial_{x}}$
\end_inset

 simply differentiates the components 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(A,B,C\right)$
\end_inset

 of the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 in the direction 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 This is the behavior familiar from standard vector analysis.
 Thus, the Levi-Civita connection 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\partial_{x}}$
\end_inset

 in flat space coincides with the familiar directional derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial/\partial x$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a less trivial example, let us consider a two-dimensional space with
 a local coordinate system 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x,y\right)$
\end_inset

 and the metric
\begin_inset Formula \[
g=dx^{2}+f(x)dy^{2},\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)\neq0$
\end_inset

 is some (known) function that depends only on 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 Let us compute 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\partial_{x}}\partial_{y}$
\end_inset

 using the same approach as above.
 We find
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
g(\nabla_{\partial_{x}}\partial_{y},\partial_{x}) & =g(\left[\partial_{x},\partial_{y}\right]+\nabla_{\partial_{y}}\partial_{x},\partial_{x})=\frac{1}{2}\partial_{y}g(\partial_{x},\partial_{x})=0;\\
g(\nabla_{\partial_{x}}\partial_{y},\partial_{y}) & =\frac{1}{2}\nabla_{\partial_{x}}g(\partial_{y},\partial_{y})=\frac{1}{2}f'(x).\end{align*}

\end_inset

In this way, the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\partial_{x}}\partial_{y}$
\end_inset

 is completely determined through its scalar products with basis vectors
 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{x}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{y}$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\nabla_{\partial_{x}}\partial_{y}=\frac{1}{2}\frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}\partial_{y}.\]

\end_inset

Similarly, one may evaluate other covariant derivatives, such as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
g(\nabla_{\partial_{y}}\partial_{y},\partial_{y}) & =0,\\
g(\nabla_{\partial_{y}}\partial_{y},\partial_{x}) & =-g(\partial_{y},\nabla_{\partial_{y}}\partial_{x})=-g(\partial_{y},\nabla_{\partial_{x}}\partial_{y})=-\frac{1}{2}f'(x).\end{align*}

\end_inset

Thus 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\nabla_{\partial_{y}}\partial_{y}=-\frac{1}{2}f'(x)\partial_{x}.\]

\end_inset

\begin_layout Subsection*
Derivation of the Levi-Civita connection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the examples above, we have computed covariant derivatives of some vectors
 by using only the defining properties\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:compatibility with the metric}

\end_inset

) and (
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Lie through nabla}

\end_inset

) of the Levi-Civita connection.
 We now derive a general formula for 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 using the same approach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the vector fields 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 are given, the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 will be unambiguously determined if we compute its scalar product 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z})$
\end_inset

 with an arbitrary vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{z}$
\end_inset

.
 So we start with the scalar product expression 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z})$
\end_inset

 and rewrite it using the assumed properties\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:compatibility with the metric}

\end_inset

) and (
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Lie through nabla}

\end_inset

),
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
g(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z}) & =\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}g(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z})-g(\mathbf{y},\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{z})\\
 & =\mathbf{x}\circ g(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z})-g(\mathbf{y},[\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z}])-g(\mathbf{y},\nabla_{\mathbf{z}}\mathbf{x})\\
 & =\mathbf{x}\circ g(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z})-g(\mathbf{y},[\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z}])-g(\nabla_{\mathbf{z}}\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}).\end{align*}

\end_inset

We have related 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z})$
\end_inset

 to the same structure with 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z}\right)$
\end_inset

 cyclically transposed.
 So now we repeat the same procedure twice more, replacing the term with
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{z}}\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 by a term with 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{y}}\mathbf{z}$
\end_inset

, and finally by a term with 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

.
 We obtain
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
g(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z}) & =\mathbf{x}\circ g(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z})-g(\mathbf{y},[\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z}])-\mathbf{z}\circ g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\\
 & +g(\mathbf{x},[\mathbf{z},\mathbf{y}])+\mathbf{y}\circ g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})-g(\mathbf{z},[\mathbf{y},\mathbf{x}])-g(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z}).\end{align*}

\end_inset

Thus the final formula for the Levi-Civita connection is
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{Levi-Civita connection!Koszul formula}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
g(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z}) & =\frac{1}{2}\big(\mathbf{x}\circ g(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z})+\mathbf{y}\circ g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})-\mathbf{z}\circ g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\nonumber \\
 & -g(\mathbf{x},[\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z}])-g(\mathbf{y},[\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z}])+g(\mathbf{z},[\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}])\big).\label{eq:LC connection ans}\end{align}

\begin_layout Standard
The Christoffel tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 describes the difference between the covariant derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla$
\end_inset

 and the coordinate derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial$
\end_inset

 in a particular coordinate system.
 Let us select a coordinate system and substitute 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}=\partial_{\alpha}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}=\partial_{\beta}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{z}=\partial_{\mu}$

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha,\beta,\mu$

 are 
\emph on
fixed
\emph default
 values of the indices) into Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:LC connection ans}

 We note that the commutators of these vectors vanish and so
\begin_inset Formula \[
2g(\nabla_{\partial_{\alpha}}\partial_{\beta},\partial_{\mu})=\partial_{\alpha}g_{\beta\mu}+\partial_{\beta}g_{\mu\alpha}-\partial_{\mu}g_{\alpha\beta}.\]

\end_inset

Now we can decompose an arbitrary vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{\lambda}u^{\lambda}\partial_{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 and compute 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\nabla_{\alpha}u^{\nu}=g^{\mu\nu}g(\nabla_{\partial_{\alpha}}\mathbf{u},\partial_{\nu})=\partial_{\alpha}u^{\nu}+\Gamma_{\alpha\mu}^{\nu}u^{\mu}.\]

\begin_inset Formula $\blacksquare$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the Levi-Civita connection 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla$
\end_inset

 is defined through the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 and thus implicitly depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

.
 For instance, the vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 involves not only first derivatives of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

, but also first derivatives of the metric.
 This is easy to see by inspection of Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:LC connection ans}

\end_inset

), where the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 clearly stands under differentiation in the first three terms.
 It is instructive to verify this statement more directly, without using
 Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:LC connection ans}

\end_inset

).
 Let us change the metric tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 as follows, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g\rightarrow\tilde{g}=e^{2\lambda}g,\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is a scalar function.
 (This transformation of the metric is called a 
\series bold
conformal transformation
\series default
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{conformal transformation}

\end_inset

because it preserves angles between vectors.) Now we can use Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:LC connection ans}

\end_inset

) to determine the new connection 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\nabla}$
\end_inset

.
 It is convenient to compute 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{g}(\tilde{\nabla}_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z})$
\end_inset

 using the 
\emph on
new
\emph default
 metric 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{g}$
\end_inset

, rather than the old metric.
 We find
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
\tilde{g}(\tilde{\nabla}_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z}) & =\left(\mathbf{x}\circ\lambda\right)\tilde{g}(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z})+\left(\mathbf{y}\circ\lambda\right)\tilde{g}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})-\left(\mathbf{z}\circ\lambda\right)\tilde{g}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\nonumber \\
 & +\tilde{g}(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z}).\label{eq:nabla after conformal}\end{align}

\end_inset

This expression contains first derivatives of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\circ\lambda$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, the Levi-Civita connection indeed involves first derivatives
 of the metric.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Remark:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we have seen in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:The-coordinate-derivative}

\end_inset

, all the possible connections (covariant derivatives) 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla$
\end_inset

 can be described by choosing a coordinate system 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x^{\mu}\right\} $
\end_inset

 (in which the coordinate derivative is 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial$
\end_inset

) and a transformation-valued 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{v}=\partial_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{v}+\Gamma(\mathbf{u})\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
 Torsion-freeness implies the symmetry 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma(\mathbf{u})\mathbf{v}=\Gamma(\mathbf{v})\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

, but 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 is not otherwise constrained.
 Of all the possible torsion-free connections, the Levi-Civita connection
 is described by a particular unique choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 determined by the metricity requirement.

\begin_layout Standard
Recall that the (2,0) tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{-1}$

 is the inverse metric defined on 1-forms, or alternatively the map from
 vectors to 1-forms to vectors.
 We now show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}(g^{-1})=0$
\end_inset

 for the Levi-Civita connection 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A simple (but less explicit) calculation is as follows.
 Consider the map 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{g}$
\end_inset

 from vectors to 1-forms and the map 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{g}^{-1}$
\end_inset

 from 1-forms to vectors.
 We have
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{g}\hat{g}^{-1}=\hat{1},\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{1}$
\end_inset

 is the identity map from 1-forms to 1-forms.
 Then
\begin_inset Formula \[
\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}(\hat{g}\hat{g}^{-1})=\hat{g}\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\hat{g}^{-1}=\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\hat{1}=0,\]

\end_inset

thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\hat{g}^{-1}=0$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here is a more detailed calculation along the same lines.
 For an arbitrary vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 and 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

, we have
\begin_inset Formula \[
\omega\circ\mathbf{v}=g(\hat{g}^{-1}\mathbf{\omega},\mathbf{v}).\]

\end_inset

Now we apply 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}$
\end_inset

 to both sides,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}(\omega\circ\mathbf{v})=\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}g(\hat{g}^{-1}\mathbf{\omega},\mathbf{v})=g(\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}(\hat{g}^{-1}\mathbf{\omega}),\mathbf{v})+g(\hat{g}^{-1}\mathbf{\omega},\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{v}).\]

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla$
\end_inset

 satisfies Leibnitz's rule with respect to tensor products and contractions,
 we find
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}(\omega\circ\mathbf{v}) & =(\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\omega)\circ\mathbf{v}+\omega\circ(\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{v})\\
 & =g(\hat{g}^{-1}(\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\omega),\mathbf{v})+g(\hat{g}^{-1}\omega,\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{v}).\end{align*}

\end_inset

The result 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\hat{g}^{-1}=0$
\end_inset

 follows.

 In terms of the components

 at any single point

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 starting from the expression 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z})$
\end_inset

 and using the defining properties of the Levi-Civita connection 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla$
\end_inset

.
 A shorter derivation and a more elegant-looking formula can be found using
 the following trick.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will have a formula for 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla$
\end_inset

 if we can compute the distortion tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{(\mathbf{x})}$
\end_inset

 of an arbitrary vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

.
 The trick is to consider the symmetric and the antisymmetric parts of 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{(\mathbf{x})}$
\end_inset

 separately.
 Let us first consider the symmetric part,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
B_{(\mathbf{x})}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})+B_{(\mathbf{x})}(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{a}) & =g(\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{x},\mathbf{b})+g(\nabla_{\mathbf{b}}\mathbf{x},\mathbf{a})\\
 & =g(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{a}-\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})+g(\mathbf{a},\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{b}-\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{b})\\
 & =\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{x}}g(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})-g(\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})-g(\mathbf{a},\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{b})\\
 & =\left(\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{x}}g\right)\circ\left(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\right).\end{align*}

\end_inset

Now consider the antisymmetric part, 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
B_{(\mathbf{x})}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})-B_{(\mathbf{x})} & (\mathbf{b},\mathbf{a})=g(\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{x},\mathbf{b})-g(\nabla_{\mathbf{b}}\mathbf{x},\mathbf{a})\\
=\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{b}) & -g(\mathbf{x},\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{b})-\nabla_{\mathbf{b}}g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{a})+g(\mathbf{x},\nabla_{\mathbf{b}}\mathbf{a})\\
 & =\mathbf{a}\circ g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{b})-\mathbf{b}\circ g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{a})-g(\mathbf{x},\left[\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\right]).\end{align*}

\end_inset

Comparing with Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:dw 12}

\end_inset

) and denoting by 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{g}\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 the 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\hat{g}\mathbf{x}\right)\circ\mathbf{a}\equiv g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{a}),\]

\end_inset

 we find
\begin_inset Formula \[
B_{(\mathbf{x})}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})-B_{(\mathbf{x})}(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{a})=\left(\textrm{d}\hat{g}\mathbf{x}\right)\circ\left(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\right).\]

\end_inset

Finally, we restore 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{(\mathbf{x})}$
\end_inset

 as a half-sum of its symmetric and antisymmetric parts.
 Thus, we can rewrite the Koszul formula more concisely as follows,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
B_{(\mathbf{x})}=\frac{1}{2}\textrm{d}\left(\hat{g}\mathbf{x}\right)+\frac{1}{2}\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{x}}g.\label{eq:Koszul L d}\end{equation}

\end_inset

Now it becomes clear why the covariant derivative of a Killing vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{k}$
\end_inset

 yields an antisymmetric 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{(\mathbf{k})}=\frac{1}{2}\textrm{d}\hat{g}\mathbf{k}$
\end_inset

.

 The result will be the derivative of

\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{u})=1$

 So the derivative

 (The 3-volume is completed to a 4-volume by the unit vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$

\end_inset

The tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{u}}\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$

The quantity

 can be expressed through the Levi-Civita connection 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla$
\end_inset

 and an orthonormal frame 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

, such that 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{e}_{a},\mathbf{e}_{b})=\eta_{ab}$

\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}

Denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

 the orthonormal basis of 1-forms dual to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 We can then compute
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{u}}\boldsymbol{\varepsilon} & =\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{u}}\left(\boldsymbol{\theta}^{0}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{1}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{2}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{3}\right)\\
 & =\left(\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{u}}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{0}\right)\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{1}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{2}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{3}+\boldsymbol{\theta}^{0}\wedge\left(\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{u}}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{1}\right)\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{2}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{3}+...,\end{align*}

\end_inset

where we omitted similar terms involving 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\theta}^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\theta}^{3}$
\end_inset

.
 We now consider the first term above.
 The 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{u}}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{0}$
\end_inset

 can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis 1-forms 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{u}}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{0}=\sum_{a}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}\left(\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{u}}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{0}\right)\circ\mathbf{e}_{a}.\]

\end_inset

 Due to antisymmetry of 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge$
\end_inset

 within 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{u}}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{0}\right)\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{1}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{2}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{3}$
\end_inset

, only the term proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\theta}^{0}$
\end_inset

 survives, so
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{u}}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{0}\right)\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{1}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{2}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{3}=\left(\left(\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{u}}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{0}\right)\circ\mathbf{e}_{0}\right)\boldsymbol{\theta}^{0}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{1}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{2}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{3}.\]

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\theta}^{0}\circ\mathbf{e}_{0}=1$
\end_inset

, we can simplify 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{u}}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{0}\right)\circ\mathbf{e}_{0}$
\end_inset

 as follows,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\left(\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{u}}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{0}\right)\circ\mathbf{e}_{0} & =\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{u}}\left(\boldsymbol{\theta}^{0}\circ\mathbf{e}_{0}\right)-\boldsymbol{\theta}^{0}\circ\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{e}_{0}=\boldsymbol{\theta}^{0}\circ\left(\nabla_{\mathbf{e}_{0}}\mathbf{u}-\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{e}_{0}\right)\\
 & =\eta_{00}g(\mathbf{e}_{0},\nabla_{\mathbf{e}_{0}}\mathbf{u}-\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{e}_{0})=\eta_{00}g(\mathbf{e}_{0},\nabla_{\mathbf{e}_{0}}\mathbf{u}),\end{align*}

\end_inset

where we used the property 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g(\mathbf{e}_{0},\left[\mathbf{e}_{0},\mathbf{u}\right])=g(\mathbf{e}_{0},\nabla_{\mathbf{e}_{0}}\mathbf{u}),\]

\end_inset

which is due to 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g(\mathbf{e}_{0},\mathbf{e}_{0})=\textrm{const},\quad g(\mathbf{e}_{0},\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{e}_{0})=\frac{1}{2}\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}g(\mathbf{e}_{0},\mathbf{e}_{0})=0.\]

\end_inset

Thus
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{u}}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{0}\right)\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{1}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{2}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{3}=\eta_{00}g(\mathbf{e}_{0},\nabla_{\mathbf{e}_{0}}\mathbf{u})\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}.\]

\end_inset

Analogous simplifications are performed for other terms, and so we obtain
 the first required formula.
 Note that
\begin_inset Formula \[
g(\mathbf{e}_{a},\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{e}_{a})=0\]

\end_inset

due to the normalization of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{a}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g(\mathbf{e}_{a},\nabla_{\mathbf{e}_{a}}\mathbf{u})=g(\mathbf{e}_{a},\left[\mathbf{e}_{a},\mathbf{u}\right]).\]

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
The formula for 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{div}\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 in the index notation can be now derived by expressing the orthonormal
 basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

 through the coordinate basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \partial_{\mu}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{a}^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 are the components of the orthonormal frame, so that
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{e}_{a}=e_{a}^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}.\]

\end_inset

 Then in the index notation we have
\begin_inset Formula \[
g(\mathbf{e}_{a},\nabla_{\mathbf{e}_{a}}\mathbf{u})=g_{\lambda\mu}e_{a}^{\mu}e_{a}^{\nu}u^{\lambda}{}_{;\nu}.\]

\end_inset

Thus
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{div}\mathbf{u}=\sum_{a}\eta_{aa}g_{\lambda\mu}e_{a}^{\mu}e_{a}^{\nu}u^{\lambda}{}_{;\nu}.\]

\end_inset

On the other hand, Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:g through estar}

\end_inset

) gives
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{a}\eta_{aa}e_{a}^{\mu}e_{a}^{\nu}=g^{\mu\nu}.\]

\end_inset

Hence, 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{div}\mathbf{u}=g_{\lambda\mu}g^{\mu\nu}u^{\lambda}{}_{;\nu}=u^{\mu}{}_{;\mu}$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The index-free notation has its advantages and disadvantages, in comparison
 with the index notation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Index-free notation emphasizes geometric operations, such as the commutator
 
\begin_inset Formula $[\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}]$
\end_inset

 or scalar product 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})$
\end_inset

, that would otherwise remain hidden under a mass of indices.
 For instance, the Bianchi identities are clearly seen to be consequences
 of the Jacobi identity and the assumptions about the Levi-Civita connection.
 Also, the geometric relations between tensors are shown explicitly, rather
 than encoded in the positions of indices.
 Thus, calculations in index-free notation help develop geometric intuition
 rather than merely an agility with manipulating indices.
 In the index notation, the same calculations appear to consist of a certain
 lucky manipulations of indices (the so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

juggling of indices
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 It remains unclear how to guess the correct sequence of index manipulations
 that would be needed for a particular calculation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Index-free notation is in many cases more concise than the index notation,
 since one does not need to write indices next to each letter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In the index-free approach, every object is defined through geometric operations
, so it is impossible to introduce a non-tensorial quantity.
 For instance, the non-tensorial Christoffel symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 in its usual form\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Christoffel components}

) is simply 
\emph on
undefined
\emph default
; instead one might define a Christoffel 
\emph on
tensor
\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

, which is a transformation-valued 1-form representing the difference between
 two given affine connections 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\nabla}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Gamma(\mathbf{u})\mathbf{v}\equiv\tilde{\nabla}_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{v}-\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{v}.\]

\end_inset

 Within the index notation, one frequently uses non-tensor quantities and
 calculates their components in a convenient coordinate system, and then
 one needs to check that the results are tensors.
 Operations with non-tensor quantities obscure the logic of a derivation
 and may lead to hard-to-spot errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Index-free notation appears more abstract, whereas expressions in the index
 notation can be easily interpreted as just 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

arrays of numbers.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Index-free notation is unwieldy if complicated contractions or symmetrizations
 are applied to tensors of high rank.
 For instance, an expression such as 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{\mu\nu;\rho}^{[\rho}B_{\alpha}^{\beta]\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 is difficult to manipulate in the index-free notation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{index-free approach}

On the whole, it appears that the index-free notation is more suitable for

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

abstract

 calculations, such as definitions of new quantities or derivations of general
 properties of tensors.
 In calculations involving complicated tensor contractions and symmetrizations,
 the index notation is better.
 For specific calculations, e.g.\InsetSpace ~
when components of a certain tensor are known
 in particular coordinates, the index notation is unavoidable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps, the index notation should be studied first, because a certain familiari
ty with the index notation seems to be helpful for learning more abstract
 material.
 However, I feel that learning to think in the index-free notation is also
 helpful, if only for the fact that the entire mathematical literature has
 been using exclusively index-free notation for several decades.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Abstract index notation
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:Abstract-index-notation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is somewhat cumbersome to use the index-free notation when dealing with
 tensors of higher rank.
 For example, suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is a transformation-valued one-form such that 
\begin_inset Formula $A(\mathbf{v})$
\end_inset

 is a linear transformation in the tangent space, i.e.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset Formula $A(\mathbf{v})\mathbf{w}$
\end_inset

 is a vector.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla A$
\end_inset

 is a transformation-valued bilinear form that acts as
\begin_inset Formula \[
(\nabla A)(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})\mathbf{w}\equiv\left[\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}A\right](\mathbf{v})\mathbf{w}.\]

\end_inset

 Note that we have some difficulty in making it clear that 
\begin_inset Formula $(\nabla A)(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})$
\end_inset

 is a derivative in the direction of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 rather than 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

, and that only 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is to be differentiated but not 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{w}$
\end_inset

.
 We could write
\begin_inset Formula \[
``(\nabla A)(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})\mathbf{w}"\equiv\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\left[A(\mathbf{v})\mathbf{w}\right]-A(\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{v})\mathbf{w}-A(\mathbf{v})\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{w},\]

\end_inset

but manipulating such expressions is a rather cumbersome affair.
 In such cases, it is more convenient to write everything in the index notation,
 e.g.
\begin_inset Formula \[
``(\nabla A)(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})\mathbf{w}"\equiv u^{\mu}v^{\lambda}w^{\alpha}\nabla_{\mu}A_{\alpha\lambda}^{\beta}\equiv u^{\mu}v^{\lambda}w^{\alpha}A_{\alpha\lambda;\mu}^{\beta}.\]

\end_inset

This notation clearly shows that the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 supplies the direction for the derivative, and the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{w}$
\end_inset

 are contracted with the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, but only 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is differentiated.
 However, when using the index notation we do not actually need to talk
 about components of the vectors in a basis; in fact, we have not really
 chosen any explicit basis so far.
 In most cases, the indices are actually used only as labels indicating
 that vectors and tensors are contracted with each other in a particular
 order.

\begin_layout Standard
The abstract index notation can be summarized as follows: An index, such
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $v^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{\alpha}$
\end_inset

, does not take values 
\begin_inset Formula $0,1,2,...$
\end_inset

, but is merely a label indicating that 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 is a vector while 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 is a 1-form.
 Repeated indices, e.g.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset Formula $v^{\alpha}u_{\alpha}$
\end_inset

, do not mean summation but instead indicate that a certain vector is being
 contracted with a certain 1-form.
 No particular basis or coordinate system is chosen or implied, and one
 is careful to perform only well-defined geometric operations on all quantities.
 (Geometric operations are the tensor product, the contraction of tensors,
 the Lie derivative, and the covariant derivative.
 The ordinary coordinate derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial/\partial x^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 is disallowed.) The results of such calculations may be interpreted either
 as coordinate-free expressions or as component expressions 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

valid in any coordinate system.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Strictly speaking, the abstract index notation disallows non-tensorial
 quantities such as the Christoffel symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\lambda}$
\end_inset

, operations with individual components of tensors such as 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{\alpha4\beta4}$
\end_inset

, or an implicit choice of a coordinate system (e.g.\InsetSpace ~
calculations in locally
 inertial coordinates).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The approach taken in this book is coordinate-free and the notation is almost
 everywhere index-free.
 However, we 
\emph on
do
\emph default
 use the abstract index notation when it is significantly more convenient.
 For instance, it is straightforward to express complicated tensor contractions
 such as 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{\mu\nu;\rho}^{\rho}B_{\alpha}^{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 in the index notation, but cumbersome without indices.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Remark: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I would like to emphasize that the index notation such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mu}A_{\alpha\lambda}^{\beta}\equiv A_{\alpha\lambda;\mu}^{\beta}$
\end_inset

 does not imply that the covariant derivative is applied to each component
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 separately.
 Rather, this notation refers to the components of the higher-rank tensor
 
\begin_inset Formula $(\nabla A)$
\end_inset

.
 For instance, the component 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{1}A_{12}^{1}$
\end_inset

 is not equal to an operator ``
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{1}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 acting on the component 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{12}^{1}$
\end_inset

 of the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 Rather, the notation 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{1}A_{12}^{1}$
\end_inset

 stands for the component 
\begin_inset Formula $(\nabla A){}_{112}^{1}$
\end_inset

 of the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla A$
\end_inset

.
 If (for example) 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{\alpha\lambda}^{\beta}=-A_{\lambda\alpha}^{\beta}$
\end_inset

 then the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

obvious
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 property 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{\alpha\lambda;\mu}^{\beta}=-A_{\lambda\alpha;\mu}^{\beta}$

 is not automatically satisfied (as it would be if 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{\alpha\lambda;\mu}^{\beta}$
\end_inset

 were a component-wise derivative of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{\alpha\lambda}^{\beta}$
\end_inset

).
 This property must be derived as a consequence of the properties of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla$
\end_inset

.
 The symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mu}$
\end_inset

 is not a collection of fixed tensors 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{0},\nabla_{1},\nabla_{2},\nabla_{3}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mu}$

 represents different operations when applied to different tensors.
 Therefore, an abstract index expression such as

\begin_layout Standard
The correspondence between the index notation and the index-free notation
 is established using the basis vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{\alpha}\equiv\partial/\partial x^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

, by assuming 
\emph on
fixed
\emph default
 values of all the indices.
 For example, consider a covector (1-form) 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{A}$
\end_inset

.
 It is represented in the index notation by the symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{\mu}$
\end_inset

, while 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\alpha}A_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 means the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\alpha,\beta\right)$
\end_inset

-component of the rank (0,2) tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla\mathbf{A}$
\end_inset

.
 For fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, the component 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\alpha}A_{\beta}$
\end_inset

 is the number defined by
\begin_inset Formula \[
A_{\beta;\alpha}\equiv\nabla_{\alpha}A_{\beta}\equiv\left(\nabla\mathbf{A}\right)_{\alpha\beta}=(\nabla_{\mathbf{e}_{\alpha}}\mathbf{A})\circ\mathbf{e}_{\beta}.\]

\end_inset

An equation written in the index notation, such as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
A_{\beta;\alpha}+g_{\alpha\beta}-2A_{\alpha;\beta}=0,\label{eq:A identity}\end{equation}

\end_inset

is converted to the index-free notation by first rewriting it as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\nabla_{\alpha}A_{\beta}+g_{\alpha\beta}-2\nabla_{\beta}A_{\alpha},\]

\end_inset

where we introduced the symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla$
\end_inset

 explicitly, and then by fixing 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha,\beta$
\end_inset

 and inserting basis vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{\alpha}\right\} $
\end_inset

, thus obtaining
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\nabla_{\mathbf{e}_{\alpha}}\mathbf{A}\right)\circ\mathbf{e}_{\beta}+g\left(\mathbf{e}_{\alpha},\mathbf{e}_{\beta}\right)-2\left(\nabla_{\mathbf{e}_{\beta}}\mathbf{A}\right)\circ\mathbf{e}_{\alpha}=0.\]

\end_inset

However, we expect that such tensor relations can be expressed

 is to contract each free index with an 
\emph on
arbitrary
\emph default
 
\emph on
vector
\emph default
.
 The resulting expression will then depend on a certain number of arbitrary
 vectors but will be independent of the choice of basis.
 Consider Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:A identity}

\end_inset

) as an example.
 Since Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:A identity}

\end_inset

) has two free indices (
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

), let us contract it with arbitrary vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 having index representations 
\begin_inset Formula $a^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b^{\beta}$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \[
a^{\alpha}b^{\beta}A_{\beta;\alpha}+a^{\alpha}b^{\beta}g_{\alpha\beta}-2a^{\alpha}b^{\beta}A_{\alpha;\beta}=0.\]

\end_inset

Then we rewrite covariant derivatives explicitly through the symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \[
a^{\alpha}b^{\beta}\nabla_{\alpha}A_{\beta}+a^{\alpha}b^{\beta}g_{\alpha\beta}-2a^{\alpha}b^{\beta}\nabla_{\beta}A_{\alpha}=0.\]

\end_inset

Finally, this equation is rewritten in the index-free notation as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{A}\right)\circ\mathbf{b}+g\left(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\right)-2\left(\nabla_{\mathbf{b}}\mathbf{A}\right)\circ\mathbf{a}=0.\]

\end_inset

Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $(\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{A})$
\end_inset

 is a 1-form acting on vectors.
 For the purpose of facilitating further calculations with the above expression,
 it might be useful to rewrite the 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $(\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{A})\circ\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
(\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{A})\circ\mathbf{b} & =\mathbf{a}\circ(\mathbf{A}\circ\mathbf{b})-\mathbf{A}\circ(\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{b})\\
 & =\mathbf{a}\circ(\mathbf{A}\circ\mathbf{b})-\mathbf{A}\circ(\left[\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\right]+\nabla_{\mathbf{b}}\mathbf{a})\end{align*}

\end_inset

or in some other form.
 In any case, we now have an equation involving 
\emph on
arbitrary
\emph default
 vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 and the known 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{A}$
\end_inset

, and we are not using any basis vectors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A somewhat more complicated example is an indexed expression involving repeated
 covariant derivatives, such as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
v^{\lambda}{}_{;\beta\alpha}-v^{\lambda}{}_{;\alpha\beta}=\nabla_{\alpha}\nabla_{\beta}v^{\lambda}-\nabla_{\beta}\nabla_{\alpha}v^{\lambda}=0.\label{eq:ab ex 0}\end{equation}

\end_inset

Contracting Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:ab ex 0}

\end_inset

) with arbitrary vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $a^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b^{\beta}$
\end_inset

, we find
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
a^{\alpha}b^{\beta}\nabla_{\alpha}\nabla_{\beta}v^{\lambda}-a^{\alpha}b^{\beta}\nabla_{\beta}\nabla_{\alpha}v^{\lambda}=0.\label{eq:ab ex 1}\end{equation}

\end_inset

We would like to rewrite this expression in the index-free notation.
 But now we encounter a difficulty: Nested covariant derivatives, such as
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\nabla_{\mathbf{b}}\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

, contain also derivatives of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

, which are not present in the expression\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:ab ex 1}

\end_inset

).
 Therefore we first rewrite
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
a^{\alpha}b^{\beta}\nabla_{\alpha}\nabla_{\beta}v^{\lambda} & =a^{\alpha}\nabla_{\alpha}\left(b^{\beta}\nabla_{\beta}v^{\lambda}\right)-\left(a^{\alpha}\nabla_{\alpha}b^{\beta}\right)\left(\nabla_{\beta}v^{\lambda}\right)\\
 & =\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\nabla_{\mathbf{b}}\mathbf{v}-\nabla_{(\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{b})}\mathbf{v},\end{align*}

\end_inset

and similarly for the other term in Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:ab ex 1}

\end_inset

), and then finally Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:ab ex 0}

\end_inset

) becomes
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\nabla_{\mathbf{a}} & \nabla_{\mathbf{b}}\mathbf{v}-\nabla_{(\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{b})}\mathbf{v}-\nabla_{\mathbf{b}}\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{v}-\nabla_{(\nabla_{\mathbf{b}}\mathbf{a})}\mathbf{v}\\
 & =\left[\nabla_{\mathbf{a}},\nabla_{\mathbf{b}}\right]\mathbf{v}-\nabla_{[\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}]}\mathbf{v}=0.\end{align*}

\end_inset

In the last line, the first commutator is simply a shorthand notation,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\nabla_{\mathbf{a}},\nabla_{\mathbf{b}}\right]\mathbf{v}\equiv\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\nabla_{\mathbf{b}}\mathbf{v}-\nabla_{\mathbf{b}}\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{v},\]

\end_inset

while the second commutator 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\right]\equiv\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 is the commutator of vector fields.

Note that if we used coordinate basis vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{\mu}$

\end_inset

 instead of arbitrary vector fields 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

, we would have 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\partial_{\mu},\partial_{\nu}\right]=0$
\end_inset

 and the term with the commutator would vanish.
 Thus we would have obtained a simpler formula
\begin_inset Formula \[
\nabla_{\partial_{\mu}}\nabla_{\partial_{\nu}}\mathbf{v}-\nabla_{\mathbf{\partial_{\nu}}}\nabla_{\partial_{\mu}}\mathbf{v}=0,\]

\end_inset

which looks quite similar to the indexed expression\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:ab ex 0}

\end_inset

).
 The simplification is due to the fact that the commutator term 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{[\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}]}\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 drops out.
 But the same simplification can be achieved without choosing the coordinate
 basis vectors.
 It suffices to assume that the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 commute.
 Since our expression is actually independent of the 
\emph on
derivatives
\emph default
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}$

, we can always choose commuting vector fields 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 in a neighborhood of any one point.
 This choice will be possible in every case when we convert an indexed expressio
n into an index-free form, since any number of simultaneously commuting
 vector fields can be chosen at a point (see, for example, Statement\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{par:Statement-exist-connecting-basis}

).
 We will frequently use this method of simplification.

\begin_layout Standard
Traces of tensors 
\emph on
can
\emph default
 be computed in the index-free notation, although in many cases calculations
 are easier in the index notation.
 Nevertheless, it is possible to develop a sufficiently powerful formalism,
 so that the index notation is 
\emph on
in principle
\emph default
 never needed.
 In this section I explain the index-free approach to calculating the trace.
 Since the readers will certainly be more familiar with the index notation
 for traces, I provide a comparison between indexed and index-free approaches.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I begin by reviewing the index-free definition of the trace of a linear
 transformation.
 A transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is expressed in a tensor form as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
T=\mathbf{a}_{1}\otimes\boldsymbol{\omega}_{1}+\mathbf{a}_{2}\otimes\boldsymbol{\omega}_{2}+...,\label{eq:T 2 decomp}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}_{j}$
\end_inset

 are some vectors and 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\omega}_{j}$
\end_inset

 are some covectors; by definition, any (1,1)-tensor can be decomposed in
 this way.
 Then the 
\series bold
trace
\series default
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{trace}

\end_inset

of 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\textrm{Tr }T=\boldsymbol{\omega}_{1}\circ\mathbf{a}_{1}+\boldsymbol{\omega}_{2}\circ\mathbf{a}_{2}+...\label{eq:T 2 trace decomp}\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, this definition is not convenient in more complicated cases.
 For example, a tensor expressed in the index notation as 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\alpha\beta}^{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 may be interpreted as a transformation-valued 1-form, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{x}\rightarrow T(\mathbf{a})\mathbf{x},\quad\left(T(\mathbf{a})\mathbf{x}\right)^{\lambda}\equiv T_{\alpha\beta}^{\lambda}a^{\alpha}x^{\beta}.\]

\end_inset

Suppose we would like to compute the trace of 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

, expressed in the index notation as 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\alpha\beta}^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

.
 According to the definition\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:T 2 trace decomp}

\end_inset

), we first need to decompose 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\alpha\beta}^{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 as a linear combination of tensor products, as in Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:T 2 decomp}

\end_inset

).
 This computation is cumbersome because a large number of tensor product
 terms will be needed in a decomposition of 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\alpha\beta}^{\lambda}$
\end_inset

.
 Also, such explicit decompositions usually require a choice of basis.
 For example, the identity operator can be decomposed as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{1}=\sum_{j=1}^{n}\mathbf{e}_{j}\otimes\boldsymbol{\theta}^{j},\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a basis and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \boldsymbol{\theta}^{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is the corresponding dual basis.
 (The above relation is called a 
\series bold
decomposition of identity
\series default
.
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{decomposition of identity}

\end_inset

) Calculations with such decompositions rapidly become unwieldy for higher-rank
 tensors, and so we will proceed by another route.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To be specific, let us first show how one can compute the trace 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\alpha\beta}^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 in a basis-free manner.
 We first 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lower the index
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\alpha\beta\lambda}\equiv T_{\alpha\beta}^{\mu}g_{\lambda\mu}$
\end_inset

, which is in the index-free notation a trilinear form 
\begin_inset Formula $T(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c})$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
T(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c})\equiv g(T(\mathbf{a})\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c}).\]

\end_inset

Then we need to specify two of three arguments of 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 which are to be contracted.
 For instance, the covector 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{\lambda}\equiv T_{\alpha\lambda}^{\alpha}\equiv T_{\alpha\beta\lambda}g^{\alpha\beta}$
\end_inset

 looks like the contraction of 
\begin_inset Formula $T(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c})$
\end_inset

 with respect to the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

.
 To make this relationship explicit, we use the following notation, 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\omega}(\mathbf{c})=\textrm{Tr}_{\mathbf{a}}T(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{a},\mathbf{c}).\label{eq:Trace example}\end{equation}

\end_inset

This notation is somewhat verbose but explicit and unambiguous.The vector
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 does not enter the final object 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\omega}(\mathbf{c})$
\end_inset

; so 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 is merely an auxiliary part of notation.
 The vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 in the right-hand side of Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Trace example}

\end_inset

) may be called a 
\series bold
mute
\series default
 
\series bold
vector
\series default

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{mute vectors}

\end_inset

, similarly to the mute index 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 used in summation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus I propose the following index-free notation for the 
\series bold
trace
\series default
 of a multilinear tensor-valued function 
\begin_inset Formula $T(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c},...)$
\end_inset

 with respect to the arguments 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

.
 The tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $T(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c},...)$
\end_inset

 is first written as a linear function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

, i.e.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset Formula $T(\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c},...)$
\end_inset

, and then the trace is found by substituting the inverse metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{-1}$
\end_inset

, which is a (2,0)-tensor, instead of the argument 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{Tr}_{\mathbf{a}}T(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{a},\mathbf{c},...)\equiv\left.T(\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c},...)\right|_{\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}=g^{-1}}.\]

\end_inset

Note that the use of the same vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 in both arguments of 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 reflects the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{-1}$
\end_inset

 is a symmetric (2,0) tensor.
 This notation often helps simplify terms that vanish due to antisymmetry.
 An alternative notation, such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{Tr}_{\left\langle \mathbf{a}\mathbf{b}\right\rangle }T(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c})$
\end_inset

, would be more cumbersome to use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The index notation for the trace above is 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{\alpha\beta}T_{\alpha\beta\gamma...}$
\end_inset

.
 In this way, the trace operation is understood as a simple substitution
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}=g^{-1}$
\end_inset

 into a multilinear function 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

.
 An explicit notation for this substitution,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\textrm{Tr}_{\mathbf{a}}T(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{a},\mathbf{c},...)\equiv\textrm{Tr}_{\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}=g^{-1}}T(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c},...)\label{eq:trace notation a b g}\end{equation}

\end_inset

could be useful when one needs to specify explicitly that the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is being used.
 For instance, one could then introduce several metrics 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

, ..., and compute traces with respect to these metrics.
 However, we will be working most of the time with one metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

, and so the verbose and explicit notation\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:trace notation a b g}

) will not be necessary.

 in an index-free form.
 When an indexed expression contains a sum over a pair of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 indices, we can first lower both indices (inserting an extra 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{\alpha\beta}$
\end_inset

) and then replace the 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{\alpha\beta}$
\end_inset

 by a pair of mute vectors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Example:

\begin_layout Standard
Let us rewrite the following equation,
\begin_inset Formula \[
u^{\alpha}u^{\beta}u^{\gamma}w_{\gamma;\alpha\beta}=C^{\lambda}{}_{\alpha\lambda\beta}u^{\alpha}u^{\beta},\]

\end_inset

 in the index-free notation.
 Using the techniques from Sec.
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Converting-expressions-into}

\end_inset

, we rewrite the left-hand side as
\begin_inset Formula \[
g(\mathbf{u},\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{w}-\nabla_{\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{w}).\]

\end_inset

 Turning now to the right-hand side, we note that it is only necessary to
 express the trace 
\begin_inset Formula $C^{\lambda}{}_{\alpha\lambda\beta}$
\end_inset

, since all other contractions are ordinary.
 The tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $C^{\lambda}{}_{\alpha\mu\beta}$
\end_inset

 can be interpreted as a transformation-valued function of two vectors,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{z}\rightarrow C(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\mathbf{z},\quad\left[C(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\mathbf{z}\right]^{\lambda}\equiv C^{\lambda}{}_{\alpha\mu\beta}z^{\alpha}x^{\mu}y^{\beta}.\]

\end_inset

(In an actual calculation, such as that in the practice problem 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \vpageref{par:Practice-problem:trace-of-C}

\end_inset

 below, we may be given an explicit, index-free formula for the transformation
 
\begin_inset Formula $C(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\mathbf{z}$
\end_inset

.) The trace 
\begin_inset Formula $C^{\lambda}{}_{\alpha\lambda\beta}$
\end_inset

 is first converted into a contraction with 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{\lambda\mu}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
C^{\lambda}{}_{\alpha\lambda\beta}=g^{\lambda\mu}C_{\lambda\alpha\mu\beta}.\]

\end_inset

The tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{\lambda\alpha\mu\beta}$
\end_inset

 is a function of four vectors, expressed through the original tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $C^{\lambda}{}_{\alpha\mu\beta}$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
C_{\lambda\alpha\mu\beta}a^{\lambda}z^{\alpha}x^{\mu}y^{\beta} & =g_{\kappa\lambda}a^{\kappa}C^{\lambda}{}_{\alpha\mu\beta}z^{\alpha}x^{\mu}y^{\beta}\\
 & \equiv g(\mathbf{a},C(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\mathbf{z})\equiv C(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{z},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}).\end{align*}

\end_inset

Thus we rewrite
\begin_inset Formula \[
C^{\lambda}{}_{\alpha\lambda\beta}u^{\alpha}u^{\beta}=g^{\lambda\mu}C_{\lambda\alpha\mu\beta}u^{\alpha}u^{\beta}.\]

\end_inset

 Finally, we introduce two mute vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 whose tensor product 
\begin_inset Formula $a^{\lambda}b^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 will replace 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{\lambda\mu}$
\end_inset

 in the contraction 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{\lambda\mu}C_{\lambda\alpha\mu\beta}$
\end_inset

.
 The result of the replacement is
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
g^{\lambda\mu}C_{\lambda\alpha\mu\beta}u^{\alpha}u^{\beta} & \rightarrow a^{\lambda}b^{\mu}C_{\lambda\alpha\mu\beta}u^{\alpha}u^{\beta}=C(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{u},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{u})\\
 & =g(\mathbf{a},C(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{u})\mathbf{u}).\end{align*}

\end_inset

The trace of this expression with respect to the mute vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 is written as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{Tr}_{\mathbf{a}}g(\mathbf{a},C(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{u})\mathbf{u})=C^{\lambda}{}_{\alpha\lambda\beta}u^{\alpha}u^{\beta}.\]

\end_inset

 index-free manner.

 Note that each mute vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},...$

 This is similar to the Einstein summation convention where each repeated

\begin_layout Standard
To determine the trace such as that in Eq.\InsetSpace ~

\end_inset

.
 One possibility to perform this calculation in the index-free notation
 is to use an explicit decomposition of the inverse metric

\end_inset

 through tensor products of orthonormal frame 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{0},\mathbf{e}_{1},\mathbf{e}_{2},\mathbf{e}_{3}\right\} $

\begin_inset Formula \[
g^{\alpha\beta}=e_{0}^{\alpha}e_{0}^{\beta}-e_{1}^{\alpha}e_{1}^{\beta}-e_{2}^{\alpha}e_{2}^{\beta}-e_{3}^{\alpha}e_{3}^{\beta}.\]

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:metric decomp 1}

\end_inset

) of the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{-1}$
\end_inset

 instead of the arguments 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $T(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z})$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\textrm{Tr}_{\mathbf{x}}T(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z},...)=T(\mathbf{e}_{0},\mathbf{e}_{0},\mathbf{z},...)-\sum_{j=1}^{3}T(\mathbf{e}_{j},\mathbf{e}_{j},\mathbf{z},...).\label{eq:trace decomp 1}\end{equation}

\end_inset

Of course, the trace does not depend on the choice of the basis.
 For instance, we may also use a decomposition of the form
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
g^{-1}=\sum_{j=1}^{n}\mathbf{u}_{j}\otimes\mathbf{v}_{j},\label{eq:metric decomp 2}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{j}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{j}$
\end_inset

 are some suitable vectors that are not necessarily linearly independent
 or orthogonal (and 
\begin_inset Formula $n\geq4$
\end_inset

).
 If we use the decomposition\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:metric decomp 2}

\end_inset

), we will have to write 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{Tr}_{\mathbf{x}}T(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z},...)=\sum_{j=1}^{n}T(\mathbf{u}_{j},\mathbf{v}_{j},\mathbf{z},...).\]

\end_inset

However, it is somewhat inconvenient to have to choose particular vectors
 for a decomposition\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:metric decomp 1}

\end_inset

) or (
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:metric decomp 2}

\end_inset

), especially since the result does not depend on the choice of these vectors.
 In many cases, a trace 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{Tr}_{\mathbf{x}}T(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z},...)$
\end_inset

 can be computed without selecting an explicit decomposition of the metric,
 especially when the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is given by an index-free expression involving fixed vectors, the metric
 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

, and covariant derivatives.

Hints:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These properties are straightforward to derive using a tensor decomposition
 of the inverse metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{-1}$
\end_inset

 in an orthonormal basis.
 As a last resort, one could rewrite all expressions in the index notation,
 but this is not necessary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Partial proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us first derive the two substitution properties.
 To show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{Tr}_{\mathbf{a}}g(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{x})\mathbf{a}=\mathbf{x},$
\end_inset

 we decompose 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\sum_{j}x_{j}\mathbf{e}_{j}$
\end_inset

 in an orthonormal basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 and use Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:metric decomp 1}

\end_inset

):
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{Tr}_{\mathbf{a}}g(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{x})\mathbf{a}=\sum_{j}g(\mathbf{e}_{j},\mathbf{x})\mathbf{e}_{j}=\sum_{j}x_{j}\mathbf{e}_{j}=\mathbf{x}.\]

\end_inset

For an arbitrary tensor-valued multilinear function 
\begin_inset Formula $A(...)$
\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{x})A(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{y},...)=A(g(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{x})\mathbf{a},\mathbf{y},...)$
\end_inset

.
 Since we already derived the desired property for 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{x})\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

, and since 
\begin_inset Formula $A(...)$
\end_inset

 is linear in its arguments, it follows that the the same trace property
 holds also for 
\begin_inset Formula $A(...)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us now derive the symmetry properties.
 Due to the substitution property, we have
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mbox{Tr}_{\mathbf{a}}g(\hat{P}_{1}\hat{P}_{2}\mathbf{a},\mathbf{a})=\mbox{Tr}_{\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}}g(\hat{P}_{1}\mathbf{b},\mathbf{a})g(\hat{P}_{2}\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}).\]

\end_inset

The last expression is obviously symmetric with respect to exchange of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{P}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{P}_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 The second symmetry property follows directly from the definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{P}^{T}$
\end_inset

.

Derivatives of mute vectors.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tensor under the trace 
\emph on
may
\emph default
 contain derivatives of mute vectors,
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{mute vectors}

\end_inset

 as long as these derivatives can be moved out of the expression or when
 the derivatives ultimately cancel out.
 In other words, the expression under the trace should be a 
\emph on
linear
\emph default
 
\emph on
function
\emph default
 of the mute vectors, not really involving their derivatives.
 Otherwise, the trace expression is 
\emph on
undefined
\emph default
 (meaningless).
 For instance, the expressions 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{Tr}_{\mathbf{a}}\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{Tr}_{\mathbf{a}}g(\mathbf{a},[\mathbf{x},\mathbf{a}])$
\end_inset

 are, strictly speaking, meaningless because the result of a calculation
 according to Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:metric decomp 2}

\end_inset

) depends on the derivatives of the basis vector fields 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 However, such meaningless expressions can occur neither by transforming
 well-defined index-free expressions nor through rewriting well-defined
 indexed expressions with traces.
 Only well-defined trace expressions can be obtained in practice.
 For instance, the following expressions containing derivatives of mute
 vectors are well-defined,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\textrm{Tr}_{\mathbf{a}}\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}g(\mathbf{a},\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{y}) & =\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\textrm{Tr}_{\mathbf{a}}g(\mathbf{a},\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{y})=\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}(\textrm{div}\mathbf{y});\\
\textrm{Tr}_{\mathbf{a}}\left(\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{x}-\nabla_{\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{x}\right) & \equiv\square\mathbf{x}\equiv g^{\mu\nu}\nabla_{\mu}\nabla_{\nu}\mathbf{x}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

 The last line is the D'Alembert operator acting on a vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

.
 The trace is well-defined because the expression under the trace is actually
 independent of the derivatives of the mute vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Computations with expressions of this kind can be simplified using the following
 trick.
 It is always possible to choose basis vector fields so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{e}_{j}}\mathbf{e}_{k}=0$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $j,k$
\end_inset

 at 
\emph on
one
\emph default
 point in spacetime.
 Hence, when computing a 
\emph on
well-defined
\emph default
 trace expression containing derivatives, one could simply assume that all
 the mute vectors are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

constant vectors,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the sense that their (covariant) derivatives in any direction are all
 equal to zero.
 This assumption is also consistent with the property 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\cdot}g=0$
\end_inset

 and a decomposition\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:metric decomp 1}

\end_inset

) of the metric through a basis that enters the trace via Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:trace decomp 1}

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this book I will use the simplifying convention that covariant derivatives
 of mute vectors are always equal to zero.
 For instance, the D'Alembert operator can then be written more intuitively
 as follows,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\square\mathbf{x}=\textrm{Tr}_{\mathbf{a}}\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{x}.\]

Summary of calculation rules

\begin_layout Standard
The formalism of coordinate-free, index-free calculations is sufficiently
 powerful to handle all situations involving vector fields and 1-forms,
 the metric, and covariant derivatives.
 (However, the index-free notation becomes cumbersome when one needs to
 manipulate tensors of higher rank.) In comparison with the index notation,
 this formalism is more transparent, emphasizes the geometric content of
 a calculation, and frequently helps to guess the necessary sequence of
 manipulations that lead to a desired result.
 I summarize the rules of index-free, coordinate-free calculations for convenien

 Explicit tensor products are written as

 Tensor contraction is written as an application of a function to a vector,

 When the metric

\begin_inset Formula \[

 The inverse metric is

\begin_layout Section
Curvature
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A motivation for introducing the concept of curvature is to describe in
 detail the deviation of the geometry of a manifold near each point from
 the flat geometry.
 A direct description of this deviation can be given using the concept of
 parallel transport (see also Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Parallel-transport-of}

\end_inset

).
 In Appendix\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cha:Elements-of-Special}

\end_inset

 a formula is derived for the parallel transport of a vector along an infinitesi
mally small closed curve, and thus the connection to the curvature tensor
 is made explicit (see Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:-Expressing-Riemann}

\end_inset

).
 In this approach, the curvature tensor is the object describing the transformat
ion of vectors under parallel transport along infinitesimally small closed
 curves.
 However, calculations in this approach require using a local coordinate
 system because otherwise the parallel transport operation cannot be described
 explicitly.
 Presently, I introduce the curvature tensor by a different formula that
 can be directly used in index-free and coordinate-free calculations.

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$

Proof of Statement

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us verify that no derivatives of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{w}$
\end_inset

 remain in 
\begin_inset Formula $R(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})\mathbf{w}$
\end_inset

; to that end, we show that 
\begin_inset Formula $R(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})\lambda\mathbf{w}=\lambda R(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})\mathbf{w}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is an arbitrary scalar function.
 This is obtained by a direct computation:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\lambda\mathbf{w} & =\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\left(\lambda\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{w}+\left(\mathbf{v}\circ\lambda\right)\mathbf{w}\right)\\
 & =\lambda\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{w}+\left(\mathbf{u}\circ\lambda\right)\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{w}\\
 & +(\mathbf{u}\circ\left(\mathbf{v}\circ\lambda\right))\mathbf{w}+(\mathbf{v}\circ\lambda)\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{w};\\
\nabla_{[\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}]}\lambda\mathbf{w} & =\lambda\nabla_{[\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}]}\mathbf{w}+([\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}]\circ\lambda)\mathbf{w};\end{align*}

\end_inset

now it is easy to see that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\lambda\mathbf{w}-\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\lambda\mathbf{w}=\lambda R(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})\mathbf{w}+\nabla_{[\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}]}\lambda\mathbf{w}.\]

\end_inset

Similarly, we show that 
\begin_inset Formula $R(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})\mathbf{w}$
\end_inset

 is a linear function also of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 (i.e.\InsetSpace ~
does not involve derivatives of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

) by computing 
\begin_inset Formula $R(\mathbf{u},\lambda\mathbf{v})\mathbf{w}$
\end_inset

.
 We use Calculation\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Statement-Lie-derivative-of-lambdav}

\end_inset

 to express 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathbf{u},\lambda\mathbf{v}\right]$
\end_inset

, and obtain
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\nabla_{\lambda\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{w} & =\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\left(\lambda\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{w}\right)=\lambda\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{w}+\left(\mathbf{u}\circ\lambda\right)\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{w};\\
\nabla_{[\mathbf{u},\lambda\mathbf{v}]}\mathbf{w} & =\nabla_{\left(\mathbf{u}\circ\lambda\right)\mathbf{v}+\lambda\left[\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}\right]}\mathbf{w}=\left(\mathbf{u}\circ\lambda\right)\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{w}+\lambda\nabla_{\left[\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}\right]}\mathbf{w};\\
R(\mathbf{u},\lambda\mathbf{v})\mathbf{w} & =\lambda\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{w}-\lambda\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{w}-\lambda\nabla_{\left[\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}\right]}\mathbf{w}=\lambda R(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})\mathbf{w}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

The analogous property for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 follows from the antisymmetry of 
\begin_inset Formula $R(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})\mathbf{w}$

 in

\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{x}=\nabla_{\mathbf{b}}\mathbf{x}=\left[\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\right]=0$
\end_inset

, we have
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
0 & =\left[\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\right]\circ g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x})=\left[\nabla_{\mathbf{a}},\nabla_{\mathbf{b}}\right]g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x})\\
 & =2g(\left[\nabla_{\mathbf{a}},\nabla_{\mathbf{b}}\right]\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x})=2R(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}).\end{align*}

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $R(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c},\mathbf{d})$
\end_inset

 within this calculation.
 First, we use the transposition properties to move the indices 
\begin_inset Formula $c,d$
\end_inset

 to the left:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
0 & =\underline{abcd}+\underline{bcad}+\underline{cabd}=\\
 & =\underline{abcd}+\underline{bcad}+(-\underline{cadb})\\
 & =\underline{abcd}+\underline{bcad}+(\underline{adcb}+\underline{dcab}),\end{align*}

\end_inset

which means that
\begin_inset Formula \[
\underline{abcd}-\underline{cdab}=-(\underline{bcad}-\underline{adbc}).\]

\end_inset

This last property can be now used repeatedly on different indices:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
-(\underline{bcad}-\underline{adbc}) & =+(\underline{cabd}-\underline{bdac}),\\
+(\underline{cabd}-\underline{bdac}) & =-(\underline{abcd}-\underline{cdab}).\end{align*}

This is a purely algebraic relation that holds for arbitrary operations

\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{b}}$

\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{c}}$

\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}$

\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}

The Bianchi identity will follow if we subtract the first of these relations
 from the second and express various terms through 
\begin_inset Formula $R()$
\end_inset

 using Eq.\InsetSpace ~

 For instance,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}

-\nabla_{[\mathbf{a,}\mathbf{b}]}\nabla_{\mathbf{c}}\mathbf{v} & +\nabla_{\mathbf{c}}\nabla_{[\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}]}\mathbf{v}+\nabla_{\left[\left[\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\right],\mathbf{c}\right]}\mathbf{v}\\
=\nabla_{\mathbf{c}}\big(R(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})\mathbf{v}\big)-R(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})\nabla_{\mathbf{c}}\mathbf{v} & -R([\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}],\mathbf{c})\mathbf{v}.\end{align*}

In the index-free notation,

The unknown tensor

 So let us compute the trace of both parts with respect to

\begin_inset Formula \[

The plan is to convert 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{b}}\mathbf{k}$
\end_inset

 into 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{c}}\mathbf{k}$
\end_inset

 using the Killing equation, to obtain a term 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\nabla_{\mathbf{c}}\mathbf{k},\mathbf{b})$
\end_inset

, and to express it through 
\begin_inset Formula $R(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{c},\mathbf{k},\mathbf{b})$
\end_inset

, which essentially differs from what we need on the right side of Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Killing R relation 1}

\end_inset

) by a cyclic permutation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

.
 To implement this plan, we need to move 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}$
\end_inset

 temporarily to the outside of 
\begin_inset Formula $g(...)$
\end_inset

, so that we can use the Killing equation:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
g(\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\nabla_{\mathbf{b}}\mathbf{k},\mathbf{c}) & =\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}g(\nabla_{\mathbf{b}}\mathbf{k},\mathbf{c})-g(\nabla_{\mathbf{b}}\mathbf{k},\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{c});\\
\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}g(\nabla_{\mathbf{b}}\mathbf{k},\mathbf{c}) & =-\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}g(\nabla_{\mathbf{c}}\mathbf{k},\mathbf{b})\\
 & =-g(\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\nabla_{\mathbf{c}}\mathbf{k},\mathbf{b})-g(\nabla_{\mathbf{c}}\mathbf{k},\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{b}).\end{align*}

\end_inset

Since the first derivatives of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 vanish by assumption, we have simply
\begin_inset Formula \[
g(\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\nabla_{\mathbf{b}}\mathbf{k},\mathbf{c})=-g(\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\nabla_{\mathbf{c}}\mathbf{k},\mathbf{b}).\]

\end_inset

We replace 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\nabla_{\mathbf{c}}\mathbf{k}$
\end_inset

 with the Riemann tensor, 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
g(\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\nabla_{\mathbf{c}}\mathbf{k},\mathbf{b}) & =R(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{c},\mathbf{k},\mathbf{b})+g(\nabla_{\mathbf{c}}\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{k},\mathbf{b})+g(\nabla_{[\mathbf{a},\mathbf{c}]}\mathbf{k},\mathbf{b})\\
 & =R(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{c},\mathbf{k},\mathbf{b})+g(\nabla_{\mathbf{c}}\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{k},\mathbf{b}),\end{align*}

\end_inset

since 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathbf{a},\mathbf{c}\right]=0$
\end_inset

.
 Thus we have derived the property
\begin_inset Formula \[
g(\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\nabla_{\mathbf{b}}\mathbf{k},\mathbf{c})=R(\mathbf{c},\mathbf{a},\mathbf{k},\mathbf{b})-g(\nabla_{\mathbf{c}}\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{k},\mathbf{b}),\]

\end_inset

where we cosmetically rearranged the order of the vectors under 
\begin_inset Formula $R(...)$
\end_inset

 to make the bookkeeping easier.
 Now we note that the structure of the last term on the right-hand side
 above is exactly the same as that of the left-hand side, except for a cyclic
 permutation of the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus we can apply this relation twice more, until the cyclic permutation
 
\begin_inset Formula $abkc\rightarrow cakb\rightarrow bcka\rightarrow abkc$
\end_inset

 is complete.
 So we find
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
g(\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\nabla_{\mathbf{b}}\mathbf{k},\mathbf{c}) & =R(\mathbf{c},\mathbf{a},\mathbf{k},\mathbf{b})-R(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c},\mathbf{k},\mathbf{a})\\
 & \quad+R(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{k},\mathbf{c})-g(\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\nabla_{\mathbf{b}}\mathbf{k},\mathbf{c}).\end{align*}

\end_inset

Using the first Bianchi identity, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
R(\mathbf{c},\mathbf{a},\mathbf{k},\mathbf{b})+R(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{k},\mathbf{c})+R(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c},\mathbf{k},\mathbf{a})=0,\]

\end_inset

we obtain
\begin_inset Formula \[
2g(\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\nabla_{\mathbf{b}}\mathbf{k},\mathbf{c})=-2R(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c},\mathbf{k},\mathbf{a}),\]

\end_inset

which coincides with Eq.\InsetSpace ~

 In that case, 
\begin_inset Formula $h\nu$

\begin_inset Formula $h$

 is Planck's constant) is the locally measured energy of a single photon
 propagating along the null geodesic 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)$
\end_inset

 The 4-vector 
\begin_inset Formula $h\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}$

The statements about the lightrays can be justified by considering a local
 coordinate system 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x^{\mu}\right\} $
\end_inset

 of an observer who has the 4-velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 and measures the frequency of an electromagnetic wave near a spacetime
 point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 In a very small neighborhood of 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

, the wave looks like a plane wave and the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 can be brought into the Minkowski form, 
\begin_inset Formula $g\approx\eta$
\end_inset

, by a choice of local coordinates.
 Then the electromagnetic potential 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{A}$
\end_inset

 near the point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 can be expressed by the familiar formula
\begin_inset Formula \[
\boldsymbol{A}=\boldsymbol{A}_{0}\exp\left[\textrm{i}\eta(\mathbf{k},\mathbf{x})\right],\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{k}$
\end_inset

 is the wave vector, 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{A}_{0}$
\end_inset

 is the amplitude of the wave, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 is a vector representing the local coordinates.
 (The wave vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{k}$
\end_inset

 is a null geodesic vector field.) In a reference frame of the observer,
 the frequency of the wave is the coefficient at 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 in the expression 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp\left[2\pi\textrm{i}\nu t\right]$
\end_inset

 in the phase of the wave; in other words,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\nu=\frac{1}{2\pi}k_{0},\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{0}$
\end_inset

 is the time component of the 4-vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{k}$
\end_inset

.
 The 4-velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 has components 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 1,0,0,0\right\} $
\end_inset

 in the observer's reference frame.
 Therefore, the frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 can be computed as 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu=\frac{1}{2\pi}\eta(\mathbf{k},\mathbf{u})$
\end_inset

 in the observer's reference frame.
 To obtain a formula for 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 valid in an arbitrary coordinate system, we need to use the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

; hence 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\nu=\frac{1}{2\pi}g(\mathbf{k},\mathbf{u}).\]

\end_inset

Since the affine parameter may be multiplied by a constant factor, we can
 choose the affine parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$

 along the null geodesic 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)$

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}=\frac{1}{2\pi}\mathbf{k}$

\begin_layout Standard
In Riemannian geometry, when the metric is positive-definite, sufficiently
 short geodesic curves have an important property: they are curves of shortest
 length among all curves connecting two given points.
 In GR, the metric is not positive-definite, so geodesic curves extremize
 the

 In this section we derive the geodesic equation from the corresponding
 variational principle.

Synge's world function provides a better variational principle since it's

 is 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
L[\gamma]=\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}\sqrt{g(\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}},\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}})}d\tau.\label{eq:Length functional}\end{equation}

\end_inset

The proper length is

 (but not necessarily maximized or minimized) if the functional 
\begin_inset Formula $L[\gamma]$
\end_inset

 does not change in first order in the perturbation when the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 is infinitesimally perturbed while the endpoints 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau_{1})$
\end_inset

 , 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau_{2})$
\end_inset

 remain fixed.
 We now apply the standard considerations of the variational calculus to
 this condition and derive the corresponding differential equation for 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A perturbation of the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 can be described as the flow of a vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

 which, we imagine, is directed 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

transversely
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 and leaves the endpoints 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau_{1,2}$
\end_inset

) in place.
 Let us denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 a parameter along the lines of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

, starting from the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, the flow of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

 transforms the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)$
\end_inset

 into a curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\gamma}(\tau;\sigma)$
\end_inset

 when we let the lines of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

 carry the points of 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 for a parameter distance 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

.
 Denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 the vector field obtained by taking tangent vectors to various curves 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\gamma}$
\end_inset

 transported the initial curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)$
\end_inset

 by various distances 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 along the flow of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

.
 By construction, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is a connecting vector for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

, and so 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{t}}\mathbf{v}=\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

.
 The proper length of a perturbed curve can now be seen as a function of
 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
L[\tilde{\gamma};\sigma]=\int_{\tilde{\gamma}}\sqrt{g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})}d\tau,\]

\end_inset

where the integration is performed along the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\gamma}(\tau;\sigma)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to the variational principle, the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 will extremize the proper length if 
\begin_inset Formula $dL/d\sigma=0$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=0$
\end_inset

.
 The operation 
\begin_inset Formula $d/d\sigma$
\end_inset

 corresponds to applying (under the integral sign) a derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{t}}$
\end_inset

 along the flow of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{d}{d\sigma}L[\tilde{\gamma};\sigma]=\int_{\tilde{\gamma}}\nabla_{\mathbf{t}}\sqrt{g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})}d\tau=\int_{\tilde{\gamma}}\frac{g(\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{t},\mathbf{v})}{\sqrt{g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})}}d\tau.\]

\end_inset

Here we have used the property 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{t}}\mathbf{v}=\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

.
 The last expression above does not contain derivatives of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 and is evaluated on the initial curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=0$
\end_inset

, hence 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left.\frac{d}{d\sigma}L[\tilde{\gamma};\sigma]\right|_{\sigma=0}=\int_{\gamma}\frac{g(\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{t},\mathbf{v})}{\sqrt{g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})}}d\tau.\label{eq:geodesic pre deriv}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 The curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 extremizes the proper length if the above integral vanishes for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The expression in Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:geodesic pre deriv}

\end_inset

) contains an undesirable derivative of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

.
 To eliminate that derivative, we now perform the usual trick consisting
 of integration by parts.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}$
\end_inset

 acts as a total derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{d}{d\tau}$
\end_inset

 along 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

, while 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}=0$
\end_inset

 at both endpoints of the curve, we have
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int_{\gamma}\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}g(\mathbf{t},\frac{\mathbf{v}}{\sqrt{g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})}})d\tau=0.\]

\end_inset

Subtracting this from Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:geodesic pre deriv}

\end_inset

), we obtain
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left.\frac{d}{d\sigma}L[\tilde{\gamma};\sigma]\right|_{\sigma=0}=-\int_{\gamma}g(\mathbf{t},\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\frac{\mathbf{v}}{\sqrt{g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})}})d\tau.\]

\end_inset

This can vanish for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 only if 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left.\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\frac{\mathbf{v}}{\sqrt{g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})}}\right|_{\gamma(\tau)}=\nabla_{\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}}\frac{\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}}{\sqrt{g(\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}},\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}})}}=0.\]

\end_inset

 This is almost the geodesic equation, except for the normalization of the
 tangent vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}$
\end_inset

.
 We now need to assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)$
\end_inset

 is not null.
 Then a redefinition of the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau\rightarrow f(\tau)$
\end_inset

 can be used to set 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}},\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}})=\mbox{const}$
\end_inset

 along 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

.
 Hence 
\begin_inset Note Note
status collapsed

\begin_layout Standard
Since an arbitrary change of the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau'=f(\tau)$
\end_inset

 does not change the proper length 
\begin_inset Formula $L[\gamma]$
\end_inset

, we may choose 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 to normalize the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})=\textrm{const}$
\end_inset

 along the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

, where the constant may be either 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm1$
\end_inset

 or zero, depending on the causal character of the curve.
 At the moment, we only consider segments of the curve that have the same
 causal character, and also assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})\neq0$
\end_inset

 (the case of null curves will be considered below).
 Similarly, the perturbed curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\gamma}$
\end_inset

 can be normalized in the same way, so that the flow of the field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

 does not perturb the normalization and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{t}}g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})=0$
\end_inset

.
 We can then drop the constant factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})}$
\end_inset

.
 Since
\begin_inset Formula \[
g(\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{t},\mathbf{v})=\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}g(\mathbf{t},\mathbf{v})-g(\mathbf{t},\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{v}),\]

\end_inset

an integration over 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 removes the total derivative term 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}g(\mathbf{t},\mathbf{v})\equiv\frac{d}{d\tau}g(\mathbf{t},\mathbf{v}),\]

\end_inset

 because by assumption the vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

 vanishes at the endpoints.
 The remaining term yields the condition
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}g(\mathbf{t},\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{v})d\tau=0.\]

\end_inset

 Since this condition should be satisfied for any vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

, 
\end_layout

\end_inset

we find 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{v}=0$
\end_inset

, which is precisely the geodesic equation\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Geodesic equation}

\end_inset

).
 Note that the resulting geodesic equation is 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 invariant under arbitrary changes of parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau\rightarrow f(\tau)$
\end_inset

 because we have already assumed a fixed normalization of the tangent vector

Remark:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a brief time in the above calculation, we needed to use expressions
 such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{t}}\mathbf{v}$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{t}}\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

, which require that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 be a vector field defined also away from the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)$

 This minor inconvenience is easily remedied by supposing that the curve

\end_inset

 can have arbitrary values away from the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 as long as

 Since the final result (the geodesic equation) contains only the derivative

 Such null geodesics 
\emph on

 be obtained by extremizing the functional\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Length functional}

 will make some portions of the curve spacelike and other portions timelike,
 and then 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{g(\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}},\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}})}$
\end_inset

 will not remain well-defined.
 To avoid this difficulty, one can simply postulate Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Geodesic equation}

 Alternatively, a different variational principle can be used to derive
 the geodesic equation\InsetSpace ~

\end_layout

Consider the variational problem with the functional

\end_inset

depending on an additional unknown function 
\begin_inset Formula $N(\tau)$
\end_inset

.
 Since the functional does not contain derivatives of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

, this variable plays the role of a Lagrange multiplier.
 The variation with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $N(\tau)$
\end_inset

 yields the constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}},\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}})=0$
\end_inset

, while the variation with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)$
\end_inset

 yields the equation
\begin_inset Formula \[
N\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{v}=-\left(\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}N\right)\mathbf{v}+\frac{1}{2}g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})\hat{g}^{-1}\textrm{d}N.\]

\end_inset

Using the constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})=0$
\end_inset

 and choosing a function 
\begin_inset Formula $N(\tau)$
\end_inset

 that is constant along the flow of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 When the Lagrange multiplier

The variational principle of Eq.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset Formula \[
L[\gamma(\tau);N(\tau)]\equiv\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}\left[\frac{g(\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}},\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}})}{N}+KN\right]d\tau,\]

 The value of

 Since

\begin_layout Standard
The motion of a massive particle corresponds to a timelike worldline

 The electromagnetic field is described by a

-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{A}$

\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 We will assume that these fields are fixed, and the question is to determine
 the trajectory 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)$
\end_inset

 of the particle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The action functional for the particle is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
S[\gamma;\boldsymbol{A},g]=-m\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}\sqrt{g(\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}},\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}})}d\tau+q\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}\left(\boldsymbol{A}\circ\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}\right)d\tau,\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is the rest mass and 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 is the electric charge of the particle.
 The first term in the action is 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 times the proper time along the trajectory, while the second term is simply
 the integral of the 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{A}$
\end_inset

 along the worldline, which may be written more concisely as 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\gamma}\boldsymbol{A}$
\end_inset

 (see Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:integral of 1-form over a curve}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 Although the actual computation is fairly short, I will go through it slowly

\begin_layout Standard
As in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Derivation of geodesic equation}

\end_inset

, we introduce a vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

 which is transverse to the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 and vanishes at 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=\tau_{1,2}$
\end_inset

.
 The vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

 perturbs the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 by shifting it to the side.
 Then we construct the vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 by shifting the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 along the orbits of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

 by different parameter distances 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

.
 The variation of the functional 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is found by applying the derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{t}}$
\end_inset

 under the integral,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\frac{d}{d\sigma}S[\gamma;\boldsymbol{A},g]=\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{t}}\left(-m\sqrt{g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})}+q\boldsymbol{A}\circ\mathbf{v}\right)d\tau.\label{eq:variation S A g}\end{equation}

\end_inset

The terms under the integral are simplified using 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{t}}\mathbf{v}=0$
\end_inset

 and the Leibnitz property of the Lie derivative.
 The first term yields
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{t}}\sqrt{g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})} & =\frac{\left(\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{t}}g\right)\circ\left(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v}\right)}{2\sqrt{g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})}}\lyxbuildrel1\above=\frac{g(\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{t},\mathbf{v})}{\sqrt{g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})}}\\
 & \lyxbuildrel2\above=-g(\mathbf{t},\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\frac{\mathbf{v}}{\sqrt{g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})}})+\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\frac{g(\mathbf{t},\mathbf{v})}{\sqrt{g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})}}\end{align*}

\end_inset

(
\begin_inset Formula $\lyxbuildrel1\above=$
\end_inset

 is via Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Lie derivative of metric formula}

\end_inset

), 
\begin_inset Formula $\lyxbuildrel2\above=$
\end_inset

 is to separate a total derivative).
 The integral of the total derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}(...)$
\end_inset

 vanishes since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

 vanishes at the endpoints 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{1,2}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus the first integral term in the right-hand side of Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:variation S A g}

\end_inset

) is simplified to
\begin_inset Formula \[
m\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}g(\mathbf{t},\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\frac{\mathbf{v}}{\sqrt{g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})}})d\tau.\]

\end_inset

The second term in the right-hand side of Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:variation S A g}

\end_inset

) becomes
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{t}}\left(\boldsymbol{A}\circ\mathbf{v}\right)=\left(\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{t}}\boldsymbol{A}\right)\circ\mathbf{v},\]

\end_inset

and then the line integral can be transformed as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}\left(\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{t}}\boldsymbol{A}\right)\circ\mathbf{v}\,\textrm{d}\tau & \lyxbuildrel1\above=\int_{\gamma}\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{t}}\boldsymbol{A}\lyxbuildrel2\above=\int_{\gamma}\left(\textrm{d}\iota_{\mathbf{t}}\boldsymbol{A}+\iota_{\mathbf{t}}\textrm{d}\boldsymbol{A}\right)\\
 & \lyxbuildrel3\above=\int_{\gamma}\iota_{\mathbf{t}}\textrm{d}\boldsymbol{A}\lyxbuildrel4\above=\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}\left(\textrm{d}\boldsymbol{A}\right)\circ\left(\mathbf{t},\mathbf{v}\right)d\tau\\
 & =-\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}\left\{ \iota_{\mathbf{t}}\iota_{\mathbf{v}}\left(\textrm{d}\boldsymbol{A}\right)\right\} d\tau\end{align*}

\end_inset

 is by the Cartan homotopy formula\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Cartan homotopy formula}

\begin_inset Formula $\lyxbuildrel3\above=$
\end_inset

 is due to 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\gamma}\textrm{d}f=0$
\end_inset

 for a function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 that vanishes at the endpoints of the curve, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lyxbuildrel4\above=$
\end_inset

 is by definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $\iota_{\mathbf{t}}$
\end_inset

).
 Putting the two terms together and evaluating the derivatives on the initial
 curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

, we find
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\left.\frac{d}{d\sigma}S[\gamma;\boldsymbol{A},g]\right|_{\sigma=0} & =\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}mg(\mathbf{t},\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\frac{\mathbf{v}}{\sqrt{g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})}})d\tau\\
 & \quad-\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}q\left\{ \iota_{\mathbf{t}}\iota_{\mathbf{v}}\left(\textrm{d}\boldsymbol{A}\right)\right\} d\tau.\end{align*}

\end_inset

The integrand above is linear in the vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

, and thus can be expressed as an auxiliary 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{V}$
\end_inset

 applied to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\left.\frac{d}{d\sigma}S[\gamma;\boldsymbol{A},g]\right|_{\sigma=0} & =\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}\left(\iota_{\mathbf{t}}\boldsymbol{V}\right)d\tau=\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}\left(\boldsymbol{V}\circ\mathbf{t}\right)d\tau,\\
\boldsymbol{V} & \equiv m\hat{g}\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\frac{\mathbf{v}}{\sqrt{g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})}}-q\iota_{\mathbf{v}}\textrm{d}\boldsymbol{A}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

 The action 
\begin_inset Formula $S[\gamma;\boldsymbol{A},g]$
\end_inset

 is extremized if the derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $dS/d\sigma=0$
\end_inset

.
 This can happen for an arbitrary field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

 only if the 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{V}$
\end_inset

 vanishes for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
 Thus we obtain the equation
\begin_inset Formula \[
\boldsymbol{V}=m\hat{g}\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\frac{\mathbf{v}}{\sqrt{g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})}}-q\iota_{\mathbf{v}}\textrm{d}\boldsymbol{A}=0.\]

\end_inset

 This is the equation of motion for a charged particle in an external electromag
netic field.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We may rewrite this equation in a more familiar form by choosing the parameter
 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})=1$
\end_inset

 and noting that the 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\boldsymbol{A}$
\end_inset

 is the electromagnetic field tensor (2-form), usually denoted 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{F}$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \[
m\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{v}=q\hat{g}^{-1}\iota_{\mathbf{v}}\boldsymbol{F}.\]

\end_inset

This can be recognized as a covariant form of Newton's law.
 The left-hand side is the proper acceleration times mass, and the right-hand
 side is the Lorentz force.
 In the index notation, this is written as
\begin_inset Formula \[
mv^{\alpha}v^{\mu}{}_{;\alpha}=qg^{\mu\nu}F_{\lambda\nu}v^{\lambda}.\]

\end_inset

Note that the electromagnetic force appears in the right-hand side, while
 the gravitational force is not explicitly introduced (but is implicitly
 present because of the covariant derivative in the left-hand side).
 In GR, the effects of gravitation are described not by forces but by the
 modification of the equations of motion due to the presence of covariant
 derivatives.

 Let us investigate how neighboring geodesics deviate from each other with
 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$

 It is natural to measure the deviation between neighbor geodesics using
 a connecting vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$

\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 In the reference frame of an observer whose time coordinate is

\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{a}=\nabla_{\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}}\nabla_{\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}}\mathbf{c}.\]

\end_inset

Let us compute this quantity using the properties
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\mathbf{v},\mathbf{c}\right]=\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{c}-\nabla_{\mathbf{c}}\mathbf{v}=0,\quad\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{v}=0,\quad\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}\equiv\mathbf{v}(p).\]

\begin_inset Formula $p$

\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}

 This follows directly from the definition of the commutator: The vector
 field 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\right]$

 is defined intrinsically through curves lying within the hypersurface and
 derivatives of functions along these curves.
 So 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\right]$
\end_inset

 is a derivative along some curve within the hypersurface, and thus must
 be a tangent vector field.
 Here is also an explicit calculation.
 Suppose that the hypersurface is specified by an equation 
\begin_inset Formula $f(p)=0$
\end_inset

; then a vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 is tangent if 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\circ f=0$

 By definition of the commutator we have (for tangent

\begin_inset Formula \[

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{induced connection}

\end_inset

 This connection is defined 
\emph on
only
\emph default
 for vector fields tangent to the hypersurface.
 We note that there is a natural flat connection 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{m}$
\end_inset

, which is acts by the partial derivatives with respect to the Cartesian
 coordinates, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\partial_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{v}\right)^{\alpha}\equiv u^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}v^{\alpha}.\]

\end_inset

We shall now see how to express the connection 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla$
\end_inset

 on the hypersurface through the existing connection 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial$
\end_inset

 in the larger space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first motivation for deriving the induced connection is the following
 heuristic consideration.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 are tangent vector fields, we can compute 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

, but the result is not necessarily a tangent vector field.
 To make it tangent, we can project 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

 onto the tangent bundle using the projection operator 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
we define
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{t}\equiv P\partial_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{t}.\label{eq:induced nabla P}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 The result is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

induced
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 covariant derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

 that has values in the tangent bundle of the hypersurface.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, it is not immediately obvious that this 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

projected
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 connection 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla$
\end_inset

 is indeed the Levi-Civita connection that would be defined intrinsically
 on the hypersurface, without using the already existing connection 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial$
\end_inset

 in a larger space.
 Therefore we give a second, more rigorous motivation: The Levi-Civita connectio
n on the hypersurface is defined by Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:LC connection ans}

\end_inset

) if we substitute 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

, the induced metric, instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $h=g$
\end_inset

 and the Levi-Civita connection for 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial$
\end_inset

, we obtain for arbitrary tangent vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
h(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z})=g(\partial_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z}).\label{eq:induced nabla def}\end{equation}

\end_inset

However, Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:induced nabla def}

\end_inset

) defines the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 only through its scalar product with an arbitrary tangent vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{z}$
\end_inset

.
 The vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 is not necessarily tangent, but Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:induced nabla def}

\end_inset

) shows that 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 must have equal scalar products with any tangent vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{z}$
\end_inset

 (and, of course, 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 must be tangent).
 Therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 must be the projection of 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 onto the tangent bundle, as shown in Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:induced nabla P}

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us note that 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{t})\equiv0$
\end_inset

 for any tangent vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

, and thus 
\begin_inset Formula \[
0=\partial_{\mathbf{u}}g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{t})=g(\partial_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{n},\mathbf{t})+g(\mathbf{n},\partial_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{t})\]

\end_inset

on the hypersurface.
 Then we can rewrite the induced connection\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:induced nabla P}

\end_inset

) using Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:P def}

\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{t}=\partial_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{t}-\mathbf{n}g\left(\mathbf{n},\partial_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{t}\right)=\partial_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{t}+\mathbf{n}g(\mathbf{t},\partial_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{n})\equiv\partial_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{t}+\Gamma(\mathbf{u})\mathbf{t},\label{eq:induced nabla}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 is the following transformation-valued 1-form,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Gamma(\mathbf{u})\mathbf{t}\equiv\mathbf{n}g(\mathbf{t},\partial_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{n})=\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\lambda}u^{\alpha}t^{\beta};\quad\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\lambda}\equiv n^{\lambda}\partial_{\alpha}n_{\beta}.\]

 Substituting 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{\mu}=\frac{1}{A}x^{\mu}$
\end_inset

, we get
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}

h(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z}) & =g(\partial_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z});\end{align*}

\end_inset

then we use 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\circ g(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z})-g(\partial_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z})-g(\mathbf{y},\partial_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{z})=0$
\end_inset

 (the flat connection 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial$
\end_inset

 is compatible with the flat metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

).
 Torsion-freeness follows by projecting onto the tangent bundle:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y}-\nabla_{\mathbf{y}}\mathbf{x}=P(\partial_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y}-\partial_{\mathbf{y}}\mathbf{x})=P\left[\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\right]=\left[\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\right],\]

\end_inset

the last equality holds since

Self-test question:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the above calculation, the connection 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 is obviously a tensor since it is defined in an invariant, geometric way
 by Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:induced Gamma}

\end_inset

).
 However, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 plays the role of the Christoffel symbol because Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:induced nabla}

\end_inset

) is written in the component notation as 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\alpha}v^{\lambda}=\partial_{\alpha}v^{\lambda}+\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\lambda}v^{\beta}$
\end_inset

 It is explained in most GR textbooks that the Christoffel symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 is not a tensor.

Our

 is defined using the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

coordinate-based
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{m}$
\end_inset

, which is in the present case the natural Cartesian coordinate system 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x^{\mu}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 If we pass to a different coordinate system 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ y^{\mu}\right\} $
\end_inset

, say to the spherical coordinate system, the components of the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 will have to be transformed according to the usual tensor law.
 The formula for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 will not be the same in the coordinate system 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ y^{\mu}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 One could say that the connection 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial/\partial x^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 itself is no longer 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial/\partial y^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 in a different coordinate system 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ y^{\mu}\right\} $
\end_inset

 and its components also need to be transformed.
 The standard GR textbooks, on the other hand, define the components 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 by a 
\emph on
fixed
\emph default
, non-covariant formula in an 
\emph on
arbitrary
\emph default

 This procedure does not define a tensor.
 So then it is no surprise that the components 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 do not transform as components of a tensor.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Remark: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following two arguments help to visualize the concept of constant curvature.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first argument appeals to the intuitive understanding that a sphere
 is a perfectly symmetrically curved surface that has a constant curvature
 at all points.
 The above calculation of the Riemann tensor obviously holds for a sphere
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\mathbf{x}\right|^{2}=R^{2}$
\end_inset

 in the usual Euclidean space.
 It makes intuitive sense to say that a sphere of radius 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 has a constant curvature equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $1/R$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, any space with a Riemann tensor\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Riemann constant curvature}

\end_inset

) is a space of constant curvature, and the value of the curvature is equal
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $1/A$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second argument is somewhat more abstract.
 The tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{\alpha\beta\lambda\mu}=R_{\lambda\mu\alpha\beta}$
\end_inset

 can be viewed as a symmetric bilinear form in the space of 2-forms, 
\begin_inset Formula $R(\omega^{(1)},\omega^{(2)})=R^{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}\omega_{\alpha\beta}^{(1)}\omega_{\gamma\delta}^{(2)}$
\end_inset

, or as a linear transformation in the space of 2-forms, 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{\alpha\beta}\rightarrow R_{\alpha\beta}{}^{\lambda\mu}\omega_{\lambda\mu}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{\alpha\beta}=-\omega_{\beta\alpha}$
\end_inset

 is an arbitrary 2-form.
 The space of 2-forms is six-dimensional, and the bilinear form 
\begin_inset Formula $R(\omega^{(1)},\omega^{(2)})$
\end_inset

 can be represented as a symmetric 
\begin_inset Formula $6\times6$
\end_inset

 matrix.
 Due to this symmetry, the corresponding transformation is diagonalizable.
 Consider the six eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}(p)$
\end_inset

, ..., 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{6}(p)$
\end_inset

 of that transformation as functions of the point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 on the manifold.
 These six scalar functions characterize (in some way) the magnitude of
 the curvature of the manifold at various points.
 Without a detailed analysis of the significance of the eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{j}$
\end_inset

 and the corresponding eigenvectors, we may heuristically expect that, for
 a manifold of 
\emph on
constant
\emph default
 curvature, all the six eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{j}$
\end_inset

 should be equal to each other and remain constant throughout the manifold.
 Thus the transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{\alpha\beta}{}^{\lambda\mu}$
\end_inset

 must be proportional to the identity map in the space of 2-forms,
\begin_inset Formula \[
R_{\alpha\beta}{}^{\lambda\mu}=\left(\delta_{\alpha}^{\mu}\delta_{\beta}^{\lambda}-\delta_{\alpha}^{\lambda}\delta_{\beta}^{\mu}\right)K,\quad K=\textrm{const}.\]

\end_inset

(The coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 must be constant also by the second Bianchi identity, once we assume that
 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{\alpha\beta}{}^{\lambda\mu}$
\end_inset

 has the form given above.) Then the comparison with the sphere shows that
 the numeric value of the curvature is 
\begin_inset Formula $K$

\begin_inset Formula \[
P\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{n}g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{x}).\]

\end_inset

 The induced connection 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla$
\end_inset

 is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial$
\end_inset

 projected onto the tangent bundle,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y}=P\partial_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y}=\partial_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{n}g(\mathbf{n},\partial_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y})=\partial_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y}+\mathbf{n}g(\mathbf{y},\partial_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{n}),\]

\end_inset

which can be also written as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y}=\partial_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y}+\Gamma(\mathbf{x})\mathbf{y},\quad\Gamma(\mathbf{x})\mathbf{y}\equiv\mathbf{n}g(\partial_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{n},\mathbf{y}).\]

\end_inset

The connection 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla$
\end_inset

 is the Levi-Civita connection on the hypersurface.
 The curvature of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
R(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\mathbf{z} & =\left[\Gamma(\mathbf{x}),\Gamma(\mathbf{y})\right]\mathbf{z}+(\partial_{\mathbf{x}}\Gamma)(\mathbf{y})\mathbf{z}-(\partial_{\mathbf{y}}\Gamma)(\mathbf{x})\mathbf{z}\\
 & =g(\partial_{\mathbf{y}}\mathbf{n},\mathbf{z})\partial_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{n}-g(\partial_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{n},\mathbf{z})\partial_{\mathbf{y}}\mathbf{n};\\
R(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z},\mathbf{t}) & =g(\partial_{\mathbf{y}}\mathbf{n},\mathbf{z})g(\partial_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{n},\mathbf{t})-g(\partial_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{n},\mathbf{z})g(\partial_{\mathbf{y}}\mathbf{n},\mathbf{t}).\end{align*}

\end_inset

In the index notation, we can write 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
R_{\kappa\lambda\mu\nu} & =\left((\partial_{\lambda}n^{\alpha})(\partial_{\kappa}n^{\beta})-(\partial_{\kappa}n^{\alpha})(\partial_{\lambda}n^{\beta})\right)g_{\alpha\mu}g_{\beta\nu}\\
 & =\left(\partial_{\lambda}n_{\mu}\right)\left(\partial_{\kappa}n_{\nu}\right)-\left(\partial_{\kappa}n_{\mu}\right)\left(\partial_{\lambda}n_{\nu}\right),\end{align*}

\end_inset

since the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\alpha\beta}$
\end_inset

 in the Euclidean space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{m}$
\end_inset

 is flat.
 It is clear that, in general, the hypersurface

\end_inset

 is not a space of constant curvature.

For calculations in a subspace, it is convenient to define a

partial metric

\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{partial metric}

\end_inset

which coincides with the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 for vectors in the subspace but is zero on vectors orthogonal to the subspace.
 Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 is defined in the entire space but 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

can only see the subspace.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The advantage of introducing the partial metric is that one can work with
 vectors from the full space, substituting vectors from the subspace only
 at the end of calculations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given a self-adjoint projector 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 onto the subspace, the partial metric 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 satisfying the above requirements can be expressed as
\begin_inset Formula \[
h(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})=g(P\mathbf{a},P\mathbf{b})=g(P\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}).\]

\end_inset

(The last equality is due to 
\begin_inset Formula $P^{2}=P$
\end_inset

 and self-adjointness.) For a standard projector\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:normal projector}

\end_inset

) to the space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}^{\perp}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{n})=1$
\end_inset

, the partial metric is
\begin_inset Formula \[
h(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})=g(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})-g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{a})g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{b}).\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we turn to the case when the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 is null.
 Then the formula\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:normal projector}

\end_inset

) fails since 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{n})=0$
\end_inset

, so 
\begin_inset Formula $g(P\mathbf{u},\mathbf{n})\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 Clearly, the transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $P\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 needs to subtract from 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 some vector whose scalar product with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 is nonzero.
 So let us try 
\begin_inset Formula $P\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{l}g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{l}$
\end_inset

 is a vector such as 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{l},\mathbf{n})=1$
\end_inset

.
 This gives 
\begin_inset Formula $g(P\mathbf{x},\mathbf{n})=0$
\end_inset

 for any 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

; however, this operator 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 is not self-adjoint, 
\begin_inset Formula $P^{T}\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{n}g(\mathbf{l},\mathbf{x})\neq P\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

, and we need to symmetrize it.
 So finally we define the map 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{projector!for null directions}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
P\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{l}g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{x})-\mathbf{n}g(\mathbf{l},\mathbf{x}),\label{eq:null projector}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where again 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{l},\mathbf{n})=1$
\end_inset

.
 It is easy to check that 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 is now self-adjoint and that 
\begin_inset Formula $g(P\mathbf{x},\mathbf{n})=0$
\end_inset

 for any 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

.
 The requirement 
\begin_inset Formula $P^{2}=P$
\end_inset

 yields the condition
\begin_inset Formula \[
0=g(\mathbf{l},P\mathbf{x})=g(\mathbf{l},\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{l}g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{x})-\mathbf{n}g(\mathbf{l},\mathbf{x}))=g(\mathbf{l},\mathbf{l})g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{x}),\]

\end_inset

which can be satisfied for all 
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset


\series default
 only if 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{l}$
\end_inset

 itself is null, 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{l},\mathbf{l})=0$
\end_inset

.
 Thus the self-adjoint projector\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:null projector}

\end_inset

) is, 
\emph on
by necessity
\emph default
, also a projector onto the orthogonal complement of another null vector
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{l}$
\end_inset

.
 The image of 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 is therefore the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mathbf{l},\mathbf{n}\right)^{\perp}$
\end_inset

 of vectors orthogonal to both 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{l}$
\end_inset

, which is not the entire 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}^{\perp}$
\end_inset

 but a 
\emph on
two-dimensional
\emph default
 subspace within 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}^{\perp}$
\end_inset

.
 Accordingly, the trace of 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 is equal to 2:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{Tr }P=4-g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{l})-g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{l})=4-1-1=2.\]

 Consider a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{v})\neq0$
\end_inset

 By assumption the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $P\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 must be orthogonal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

, and then the condition of self-adjointness yields a contradiction:
\begin_inset Formula \[
0\neq g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{v})=g(P\mathbf{n},\mathbf{v})=g(\mathbf{n},P\mathbf{v})=0.\]

\end_inset

In other words, we cannot project 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 while keeping the scalar product of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 constant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The orthogonal complement subspace 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}^{\perp}$
\end_inset

 has a naturally induced metric, which is just the restriction of the full
 metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 onto 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}^{\perp}$
\end_inset

.
 However, the induced metric is 
\emph on
degenerate
\emph default
 since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 is orthogonal to every vector in the subspace.
 It is awkward to work with a degenerate metric; for instance, tensors specified
 only through their scalar products with vectors from 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}^{\perp}$
\end_inset

 become ambiguous (defined up to multiples of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

).
 To avoid this inconvenience, we may further restrict the subspace 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}^{\perp}$
\end_inset

 to a two-dimensional subspace 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mathbf{l},\mathbf{n}\right)^{\perp}$
\end_inset

 which is the image of a projector 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

.
 The induced metric is nondegenerate on the subspace 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mathbf{l},\mathbf{n}\right)^{\perp}$
\end_inset

.
 However, this subspace is not uniquely selected since it depends on the
 choice of a second null vector, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{l}$
\end_inset

.
 Despite these difficulties, we will obtain unambiguous results that are
 independent of the freedom in the choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{l}$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us now compare the projectors for the spaces 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}^{\perp}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}^{\perp}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}^{\perp}$
\end_inset

, where the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v},\mathbf{n},\mathbf{s}$
\end_inset

 are respectively timelike, null, and spacelike:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
P_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{x} & =\mathbf{x}-g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{x})\mathbf{v},\quad g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})=1,\quad\textrm{Tr }P_{\mathbf{v}}=3;\\
P_{\mathbf{n}}\mathbf{x} & =\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{l}g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{x})-\mathbf{n}g(\mathbf{l},\mathbf{x}),\quad g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{l})=1,\quad\textrm{Tr }P_{\mathbf{n}}=2;\\
P_{\mathbf{s}}\mathbf{x} & =x+g(\mathbf{s},\mathbf{x})\mathbf{s},\quad g(\mathbf{s},\mathbf{s})=-1,\quad\textrm{Tr }P_{\mathbf{s}}=3.\end{align*}

\end_inset

We find that the timelike and the spacelike cases are quite similar but
 differ from the null case.
 The partial metrics are
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
h_{\mathbf{v}}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}) & =g(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})-g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{a})g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{b});\label{eq:hv partial timelike metric}\\
h_{\mathbf{n}}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}) & =g(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})-g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{a})g(\mathbf{l},\mathbf{b})-g(\mathbf{l},\mathbf{a})g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{b});\label{eq:hn partial null metric}\\
h_{\mathbf{s}}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}) & =g(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})+g(\mathbf{s},\mathbf{a})g(\mathbf{s},\mathbf{b}).\nonumber \end{align}

\end_inset

We can also write the

partial inverse metrics

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{partial inverse metric}

which are (2,0)-tensors obtained from the above partial metrics by using

\begin_inset Formula \[
h^{-1}(\omega_{1},\omega_{2})\equiv h(\hat{g}\omega_{1},\hat{g}\omega_{2}),\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{1}$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{2}$

 are arbitrary 1-forms.
 We find
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}

h_{\mathbf{n}}^{-1} & =g^{-1}-\mathbf{n}\otimes\mathbf{l}-\mathbf{l}\otimes\mathbf{n},\\

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to investigate the signature the partial metrics on the

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}_{1},\mathbf{s}_{2},\mathbf{s}_{3}$

 Then we find 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{\mathbf{v}}(\mathbf{s}_{j},\mathbf{s}_{k})=-\delta_{jk}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $h_{\mathbf{v}}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(---\right)$
\end_inset

 For the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{\mathbf{n}}$

\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{l},\mathbf{n},\mathbf{s}_{1},\mathbf{s}_{2}\right\} $

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}_{1},\mathbf{s}_{2}$
\end_inset

 are spacelike and orthogonal to each other and to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{l},\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 Then we find 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{\mathbf{n}}(...,\mathbf{l})=h_{\mathbf{n}}(...,\mathbf{n})=0$
\end_inset

, while 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{\mathbf{n}}(\mathbf{s}_{j},\mathbf{s}_{k})=-\delta_{jk}$
\end_inset

, and therefore the partial signature of 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{\mathbf{s}}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(--\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Finally, for the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{\mathbf{s}}$
\end_inset

 we choose an orthogonal basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{s},\mathbf{v}_{1},\mathbf{s}_{2},\mathbf{s}_{3}\right\} $

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}$
\end_inset

 is a timelike vector and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}_{2},\mathbf{s}_{3}$
\end_inset

 are spacelike.
 Thus the partial signature of 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{\mathbf{s}}$

A(\mathbf{s}_{1},\mathbf{s}_{2})=\left|g(\mathbf{s}_{1},\mathbf{s}_{1})g(\mathbf{s}_{2},\mathbf{s}_{2})-g(\mathbf{s}_{1},\mathbf{s}_{2})g(\mathbf{s}_{2},\mathbf{s}_{1})\right|^{1/2}.\]

\end_inset

 The change of the area along the orbits of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 is described by the directional derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}A(\mathbf{s}_{1},\mathbf{s}_{2})$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is easier to compute 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}A(\mathbf{s}_{1},\mathbf{s}_{2})$
\end_inset

 if we note that 
\begin_inset Formula $A(\mathbf{s}_{1},\mathbf{s}_{2})$
\end_inset

 is equal to the 4-volume spanned by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}_{1},\mathbf{s}_{2}$
\end_inset

 and two unit vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 orthogonal to both 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 For instance, we may choose 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 to be spacelike and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 to be timelike, 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{y})=1=-g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

.
 The 2-volume 
\begin_inset Formula $A(\mathbf{s}_{1},\mathbf{s}_{2})$
\end_inset

 is then interpreted as the area measured in the reference frame of an observer
 moving along the timelike direction 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

.
 (Of course, the area 
\begin_inset Formula $A(\mathbf{s}_{1},\mathbf{s}_{2})$
\end_inset

 is observer-independent since it is defined regardless of the choice of
 the auxiliary vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

.) The 4-volume spanned by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}_{1},\mathbf{s}_{2},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 is expressed through the Levi-Civita symbol as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
A(\mathbf{s}_{1},\mathbf{s}_{2})=\varepsilon(\mathbf{s}_{1},\mathbf{s}_{2},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}).\label{eq:Area through s s x y}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 is totally antisymmetric, the expression 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c},\mathbf{d})$
\end_inset

 can be interpreted as a linear function of the totally antisymmetric (4,0)-tens
or 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}\wedge\mathbf{d}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\wedge\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 is the exterior (antisymmetric) product of vectors.
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{exterior product of vectors}

\end_inset

 Thus, the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 in Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Area through s s x y}

\end_inset

) can be replaced by their linear combinations 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}'$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}'$
\end_inset

 as long as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\wedge\mathbf{y}=\mathbf{x}'\wedge\mathbf{y}'$
\end_inset

.
 It turns out to be convenient for the calculation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}A$
\end_inset

 to choose the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}',\mathbf{y}'$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}'=\mathbf{l}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}'=\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{l}$
\end_inset

 is the null vector orthogonal to both 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}_{2}$
\end_inset

 and related to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{l},\mathbf{n})=1$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Paragraph
Statement:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed the choice 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}'=\mathbf{l}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}'=\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 is possible, i.e.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\wedge\mathbf{y}=\mathbf{l}\wedge\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Derivation:
\emph default
 Write the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}'=\mathbf{l},\mathbf{y}'=\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 as linear combinations of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 with unknown coefficients: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{l}=a_{1}\mathbf{x}+b_{1}\mathbf{y},\quad\mathbf{n}=a_{2}\mathbf{x}+b_{2}\mathbf{y}.\]

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=0$
\end_inset

, the conditions 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{l},\mathbf{l})=g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{n})=0$
\end_inset

 give
\begin_inset Formula \[
a_{1}^{2}=b_{1}^{2},\quad a_{2}^{2}=b_{2}^{2},\]

\end_inset

so we could choose 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1}=b_{1},a_{2}=-b_{2}$
\end_inset

 (the signs must differ, or else 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{l}$
\end_inset

 will come out parallel to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

).
 Then we have 
\begin_inset Formula $1=g(\mathbf{l},\mathbf{n})=-2a_{1}a_{2}$
\end_inset

 and
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{l}\wedge\mathbf{n}=-2a_{1}a_{2}\mathbf{x}\wedge\mathbf{y}=\mathbf{x}\wedge\mathbf{y}.\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus the area is expressed as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
A=\varepsilon(\mathbf{s}_{1},\mathbf{s}_{2},\mathbf{l},\mathbf{n}).\]

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}_{1,2}$
\end_inset

 are connecting vectors, the derivative of the area 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 along the lines of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 is most conveniently computed by using the Lie derivative,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\frac{dA}{d\tau} & =\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{n}}A=\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{n}}\varepsilon(\mathbf{s}_{1},\mathbf{s}_{2},\mathbf{l},\mathbf{n})\\
 & =(\textrm{div}\mathbf{n})\varepsilon(\mathbf{s}_{1},\mathbf{s}_{2},\mathbf{l},\mathbf{n})+\varepsilon(\mathbf{s}_{1},\mathbf{s}_{2},\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{n}}\mathbf{l},\mathbf{n}).\end{align*}

\end_inset

We need to retain the last term above because 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{l}$
\end_inset

 is 
\emph on
not necessarily 
\emph default
a connecting vector for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Let us compute the scalar product of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{n}}\mathbf{l}\equiv\left[\mathbf{n},\mathbf{l}\right]$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
g(\mathbf{n},\left[\mathbf{n},\mathbf{l}\right]) & =g(\mathbf{n},\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}\mathbf{l})-g(\mathbf{n},\nabla_{\mathbf{l}}\mathbf{n})\\
 & =\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{l})-g(\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}\mathbf{n},\mathbf{l})-\frac{1}{2}\nabla_{\mathbf{l}}g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{n})=0.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathbf{l},\mathbf{n}\right]$
\end_inset

 is a linear combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}_{1}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon(\mathbf{s}_{1},\mathbf{s}_{2},\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{n}}\mathbf{l},\mathbf{n})=0$
\end_inset

 regardless of the choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{l}$
\end_inset

.
 (This is to be expected since 
\begin_inset Formula $A(\mathbf{s}_{1},\mathbf{s}_{2})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}A(\mathbf{s}_{1},\mathbf{s}_{2})$
\end_inset

 are defined independently of the choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{l}$
\end_inset

.) Finally, we find 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\frac{dA}{d\tau}=(\textrm{div}\mathbf{n})A.\label{eq:dAdt divn}\end{equation}

\end_inset

The divergence 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{div}\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 is thus interpreted as the relative rate of change in the area spanned
 by the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}_{1},\mathbf{s}_{2}$
\end_inset

 as this area is being transported by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

Three-dimensional hypersurfaces

\begin_layout Standard
A convenient way to define a 3-dimensional hypersurface is through an equation
 
\begin_inset Formula $f(p)=0$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $f(p)$

 is an auxiliary function.
 In this way the hypersurface can be visualized as the locus of constant

 A vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}\circ f=0$

 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\circ f$

 In Cartesian coordinates, this would be

 So a field

\end_inset

 is (locally) integrable if it is dual to a 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{g}\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 which is closed, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{d}(\hat{g}\mathbf{v})=0.\]

\end_inset

 Let us now motivate this well-known condition by more intuitive considerations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are trying to find a function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(p)$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is the gradient of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

.
 Such a function could be found by integrating the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

work done by the force field
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 from some initial point 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$
\end_inset

 to the point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 The work corresponding to an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

infinitesimal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 displacement 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{l}\delta$
\end_inset

 in the direction of a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{l}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{l})\delta=\left(\hat{g}\mathbf{v}\right)\circ\mathbf{l}\delta,\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{g}\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is the 1-form corresponding to the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
 [Recall that the 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{g}\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 acts on vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $(\hat{g}\mathbf{v})\circ\mathbf{a}\equiv g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{a})$
\end_inset

.] So our candidate function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 would be defined by integrating this 1-form along a path leading from 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \[
f(p)=\int_{p_{0}}^{p}\hat{g}\mathbf{v}.\]

\end_inset

If the function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is well-defined then we will have 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}f=\hat{g}\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 as required.
 However, the function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is well-defined only if the value 
\begin_inset Formula $f(p)$
\end_inset

 is independent of the path of integration, which is the case only if the
 integral along any closed loop 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 vanishes, 
\begin_inset Formula $\oint_{L}\hat{g}\mathbf{v}=0$
\end_inset

.
 By the integration theorem (a generalization of Stokes's law),
\begin_inset Formula \[
\oint_{L}\hat{g}\mathbf{v}=\int_{A}\textrm{d}(\hat{g}\mathbf{v}),\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is a surface enclosed by the loop 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

.
 Thus the two-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\hat{g}\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 must be everywhere equal to zero (this follows by considering infinitesimal
 loops around each point).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us now obtain a more convenient form of this condition.
 The 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\hat{g}\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 acts on arbitrary vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 according to Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:dw 12}

\end_inset

),
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
(\textrm{d}\hat{g}\mathbf{v})\circ(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}) & =\mathbf{a}\circ\hat{g}\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{b})-\mathbf{b}\circ\hat{g}\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{a})-\hat{g}\mathbf{v}([\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}])\\
 & =\mathbf{a}\circ g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{b})-\mathbf{b}\circ g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{a})-g(\mathbf{v},[\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}])\\
 & \equiv\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{b})-\nabla_{\mathbf{b}}g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{a})-g(\mathbf{v},[\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}])\\
 & =g(\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{v},\mathbf{b})-g(\nabla_{\mathbf{b}}\mathbf{v},\mathbf{a}).\end{align*}

\end_inset

The condition we are looking for is therefore
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
g(\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{v},\mathbf{b})-g(\nabla_{\mathbf{b}}\mathbf{v},\mathbf{a})=0.\label{eq:dgv ab}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Written in the index notation using the covariant components of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

, this condition becomes
\begin_inset Formula \[
\nabla_{\alpha}v_{\beta}-\nabla_{\beta}v_{\alpha}=0.\]

\end_inset

This condition is reminiscent of the curl (rotation), 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla\times\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

, in three-dimensional vector analysis, where a vector field is a gradient
 if its curl vanishes.
 By analogy, the 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\hat{g}\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is called the

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another way to express the integrability condition is to define the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

-dependent bilinear form 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
B_{(\mathbf{v})}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})\equiv g(\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{v},\mathbf{b}),\label{eq:Bv def}\end{equation}

\begin_inset Formula $B_{(\mathbf{v})}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})=B_{(\mathbf{v})}(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{a})$

 Note that in general, the rotation 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\hat{g}\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is twice the antisymmetric part of

\begin_layout Standard
(See also the proof of the statement in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\omega\equiv\textrm{d}(\hat{g}\mathbf{v})$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$

:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
(\iota_{\mathbf{v}}\textrm{d}\omega)\circ\mathbf{a} & \equiv(\textrm{d}\omega)\circ(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{a})=g(\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{v},\mathbf{a})-\frac{1}{2}\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})\\
 & =g(\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{v},\mathbf{a}).\end{align*}

\end_inset

For an integrable field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\omega=0$

 and so 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{v},\mathbf{a})=0$

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{v}=0$

 Note that it does not follow from 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{v}=0$
\end_inset

 that 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\omega=0$
\end_inset

, but only that 
\begin_inset Formula $\iota_{\mathbf{v}}\textrm{d}\omega=0$

 Thus a normalized geodesic field is not necessarily integrable.

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Derivation:
\emph default
 By assumption, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is integrable, so 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{(\mathbf{v})}$
\end_inset

 is symmetric and for an arbitrary vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$

 we have
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
g(\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{v},\mathbf{x}) & =B_{(\mathbf{v})}(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{x})=B_{(\mathbf{v})}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{v})\\
 & =g(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})=\frac{1}{2}\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v}).\end{align*}

\end_inset

So the 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 dual to the field 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is a gradient of the scalar function

\begin_layout Subsection
Frobenius theorem
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:Frobenius-theorem}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Frobenius theorem gives a sufficient and necessary condition for a vector
 field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 to be hypersurface orthogonal.
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{vector field!hypersurface orthogonal}

\end_inset

The condition is written in the language of differential forms as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\omega\wedge\textrm{d}\omega=0,\quad\textrm{where}\quad\omega\equiv\hat{g}\mathbf{v},\]

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{g}\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is the 1-form dual to the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
 Let us motivate the formulation of the Frobenius theorem before we begin
 to prove it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A hypersurface orthogonal vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is everywhere parallel to the contravariant gradient 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{g}^{-1}(\textrm{d}f)$
\end_inset

 of some function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 describing a family of hypersurfaces 
\begin_inset Formula $f(p)=\textrm{const}$
\end_inset

.
 The condition of being parallel is most concisely expressed in the language
 of differential forms: Two 1-forms 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{2}$
\end_inset

 are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

parallel
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{1}\wedge\omega_{2}=0$
\end_inset

.
 So we are prompted to reformulate the condition\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:hypersurface orthogonal cond}

\end_inset

) in the following way.
 Denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\equiv\hat{g}^{-1}\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 the 1-form dual to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

; then the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is hypersurface orthogonal if there exists a function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\wedge\textrm{d}f=0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, it is inconvenient to involve an unknown function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 in the condition 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\wedge\textrm{d}f=0$
\end_inset

.
 We can try to eliminate the unknown 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}f$
\end_inset

 from this condition by computing
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{d}(\omega\wedge\textrm{d}f)=\textrm{d}\omega\wedge\textrm{d}f=0,\]

\end_inset

so 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\omega$
\end_inset

 is also 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

parallel to 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}f$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 just as 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 is.
 Heuristically we may say that both 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\omega$
\end_inset

 are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

parallel
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to an unknown 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}f$
\end_inset

, so the exterior product of 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\omega$
\end_inset

 must vanish, 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\wedge\textrm{d}\omega=0$
\end_inset

.
 Thus we have eliminated the unknown 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}f$
\end_inset

 and obtained a condition, 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\wedge\textrm{d}\omega=0$
\end_inset

, that conveniently involves only the given 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 (equivalently, the given vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

).
 Now we shall begin the proof of the Frobenius theorem.

 this will be a scalar function 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 and we will have 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega=\psi\theta$
\end_inset

.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Proof: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idea is to think that 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

parallel to 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and to obtain the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

components
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 that are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

not parallel to 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 To obtain the components of a form, we can use a basis of vectors.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta\neq0$
\end_inset

, we can choose a basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{0},\mathbf{v}_{1},\mathbf{v}_{2},...\right\} $
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta\circ\mathbf{v}_{0}=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta\circ\mathbf{v}_{j}=0$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $j\geq1$
\end_inset

.
 Then for any basis vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{s_{j}}\neq\mathbf{v}_{0}$
\end_inset

 we have
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\left(\theta\wedge\omega\right)\circ(\mathbf{v}_{0},\mathbf{v}_{s_{1}},\mathbf{v}_{s_{2}},...) & =\theta(\mathbf{v}_{0})=\omega\circ(\mathbf{v}_{s_{1}},\mathbf{v}_{s_{2}},...)\\
 & =\omega\circ(\mathbf{v}_{s_{1}},\mathbf{v}_{s_{2}},...)=0.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 is zero on any sets of basis vectors that does not contain 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{0}$
\end_inset

, but 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega(\mathbf{v}_{0},\mathbf{v}_{s_{1}},\mathbf{v}_{s_{2}},...)$
\end_inset

 may be nonzero.
 So we define the 
\begin_inset Formula $(n-1)$
\end_inset

-form 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\psi\equiv\iota_{\mathbf{v}_{0}}\omega;\quad\psi(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y},...)\equiv\omega(\mathbf{v}_{0},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y},...).\]

\end_inset

 It is easy to show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega=\theta\wedge\psi$
\end_inset

 on any set of basis vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{j}$
\end_inset

 and thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega=\theta\wedge\psi$
\end_inset

 on any vectors.
 Note that the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is defined up to a multiple of 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

, because a choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{0}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{0}$
\end_inset

 will yield 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta\circ(\mathbf{v}_{0}^{\prime}-\mathbf{v}_{0})=0$
\end_inset

 and thus
\begin_inset Formula \[
\psi^{\prime}=\psi+\iota_{\mathbf{v}_{0}^{\prime}-\mathbf{v}_{0}}\omega=\psi+\iota_{\mathbf{v}_{0}^{\prime}-\mathbf{v}_{0}}(\theta\wedge\psi)=\psi-\theta\wedge\iota_{\mathbf{v}_{0}^{\prime}-\mathbf{v}_{0}}\psi.\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An immediate corollary is: If two forms 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{1},\omega_{2}$
\end_inset

 are both parallel to the same 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{1}\wedge\omega_{2}=0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By Lemma 1, it follows from 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}f\wedge\textrm{d}\omega=0$
\end_inset

 that 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega=\theta\wedge\textrm{d}f$
\end_inset

 for some 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

.
 Thus the forms 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\omega$
\end_inset

 are both 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

parallel to
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 some unknown 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}f$
\end_inset

 and then 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\wedge\textrm{d}\omega=0$
\end_inset

.
 This is one direction of the Frobenius theorem.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It remains to prove the converse statement, namely that if 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\wedge\textrm{d}\omega=0$
\end_inset

 then there exists a surface which is everywhere orthogonal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can try to construct such a surface by choosing some vector fields 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

 orthogonal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 and following the orbits of all such 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

.
 It is sufficient to choose a basis of vector fields 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}_{1},\mathbf{t}_{2},\mathbf{t}_{3}$
\end_inset

 orthogonal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
 However, the orbits of these vector fields will not necessarily form a
 single surface.
 For instance, we may follow an orbit of a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and then a line of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}_{2}$
\end_inset

, and we shall not necessarily arrive at the same point as when we are following
 first 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}_{2}$
\end_inset

 and then 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 For infinitesimal distances, the discrepancy is in the direction of the
 commutator 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathbf{t}_{1},\mathbf{t}_{2}\right]$
\end_inset

.
 This direction must be orthogonal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 if all the orbits are to lie within a single surface.
 Therefore, surfaces orthogonal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 will exist if for any two vector fields 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}_{1},\mathbf{t}_{2}$
\end_inset

 orthogonal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

, the commutator 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathbf{t}_{1},\mathbf{t}_{2}\right]$
\end_inset

 is again orthogonal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
 We shall now see that this is indeed the case if 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\wedge\textrm{d}\omega=0$
\end_inset

.

 This motivates us to formulate and prove the following statement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Lemma 2:

\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 is the 1-form dual to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\right]$
\end_inset

 is also orthogonal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Proof: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The conditions on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega(\mathbf{x})=\omega(\mathbf{y})=0$
\end_inset

.
 By Lemma 1, 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\omega=\theta\wedge\omega$
\end_inset

 for some 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

.
 Then we have
\begin_inset Formula \[
(\textrm{d}\omega)\circ(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=(\theta\wedge\omega)\circ(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=\theta(\mathbf{x})\omega(\mathbf{y})-\theta(\mathbf{y})\omega(\mathbf{x})=0.\]

\end_inset

On the other hand, from Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:dw 12}

\end_inset

) we find
\begin_inset Formula \[
(\textrm{d}\omega)\circ(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=\mathbf{x}\circ\omega(\mathbf{y})-\mathbf{y}\circ\omega(\mathbf{x})-\omega([\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}])=-\omega([\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}]).\]

\end_inset

 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega([\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}])=0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It follows from Lemma\InsetSpace ~
2 that vector fields orthogonal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 will have surface-forming orbits if 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\wedge\textrm{d}\omega=0$

 This concludes the proof of the Frobenius theorem.

\begin_layout Paragraph

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a normalized and geodesic field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$

\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{v}=0$

\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})=\textrm{const}$

\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
(\iota_{\mathbf{v}}\textrm{d}\omega)\circ\mathbf{x}\equiv(\textrm{d}\omega)\circ(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{x})=g(\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{v},\mathbf{x})-g(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})=0.\label{eq:iv dw}\end{equation}

\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\omega$

\series bold
transverse
\series default
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{transverse tensor}

\end_inset

to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
 The proof can now proceed in one of two ways.
 If we consider the 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\iota_{\mathbf{v}}(\omega\wedge\textrm{d}\omega)$
\end_inset

 which vanishes since 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\wedge\textrm{d}\omega=0$
\end_inset

, we find
\begin_inset Formula \[
0=\iota_{\mathbf{v}}(\omega\wedge d\omega)=\left(\iota_{\mathbf{v}}\omega\right)d\omega-\omega\wedge\left(\iota_{\mathbf{v}}d\omega\right)=\omega(\mathbf{v})d\omega.\]

\end_inset

Since the field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is by assumption not null, 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega(\mathbf{v})\equiv g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})\neq0$
\end_inset

, and it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\omega=0$
\end_inset

, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
the field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is integrable.
 Another, more constructive way to prove the statement is the following.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 vectors are everywhere parallel to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
 This family of surfaces can be described by a function 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

, and the vector field normal to the surfaces is 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{g}^{-1}\textrm{d}\nu$
\end_inset

.
 Since this field is parallel to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

, there exists a scalar function 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\neq0$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}=\lambda\hat{g}^{-1}\textrm{d}\nu$
\end_inset

 or equivalently 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega=\lambda\textrm{d}\nu$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\omega=\textrm{d}\lambda\wedge\textrm{d}\nu$
\end_inset

.
 Then Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:iv dw}

\end_inset

) gives
\begin_inset Formula \[
0=\iota_{\mathbf{v}}\textrm{d}\omega=\textrm{d}\lambda(\mathbf{v})\textrm{d}\nu-\textrm{d}\nu(\mathbf{v})\textrm{d}\lambda\equiv(\mathbf{v}\circ\lambda)\textrm{d}\nu-\frac{1}{\lambda}\omega(\mathbf{v})\textrm{d}\lambda.\]

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega(\mathbf{v})\neq0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\neq0$
\end_inset

, we can express
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{d}\lambda=\frac{\left(\mathbf{v}\circ\lambda\right)\lambda}{\omega(\mathbf{v})}\textrm{d}\nu,\]

\end_inset

and it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\omega=\textrm{d}\lambda\wedge\textrm{d}\nu=0$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
It is interesting to see where the argument fails for 
\emph on

\emph default
 fields 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

: We cannot divide by 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega(\mathbf{v})$
\end_inset

 because 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega(\mathbf{v})=g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})=0$
\end_inset

.
 Indeed, we can still find 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega=\lambda\textrm{d}\nu$
\end_inset

, but the transversality 
\begin_inset Formula $\iota_{\mathbf{v}}\textrm{d}\omega=0$
\end_inset

 yields only 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\circ\lambda=0$
\end_inset

.
 This condition can be satisfied by a function 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 whose gradients are orthogonal to the null vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

, in other words, 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{-1}(\textrm{d}\lambda,\omega)=0$
\end_inset

.
 However, the gradient 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\lambda$
\end_inset

 does not need to be parallel to 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

, and thus we might have 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\omega=\textrm{d}\lambda\wedge\textrm{d}\nu\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 An explicit example can be easily found in Minkowski spacetime: Choose
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu=t-x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=y$
\end_inset

, such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\lambda$
\end_inset

 is orthogonal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\nu$
\end_inset

.
 Then the vector field dual to 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\equiv\lambda\textrm{d}\nu$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}=y(\partial_{t}+\partial_{x})$
\end_inset

, and we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\iota_{\mathbf{v}}\omega=0$
\end_inset

.
 So 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is geodesic, null, and hypersurface orthogonal (to surfaces of constant
 
\begin_inset Formula $x-t$

 Since

 Let

 We shall now show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\tilde{\mathbf{v}}}(\omega\wedge\textrm{d}\omega)=0$

 This would mean that the Lie-propagated 3-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\wedge\textrm{d}\omega$

 remains zero along the orbits of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{v}}$
\end_inset

 when applied to a Lie-propagated basis of connecting vectors to 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{v}}$

\begin_inset Formula $\omega\wedge\textrm{d}\omega=0$

 We compute 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\left(\mathcal{L}_{\tilde{\mathbf{v}}}\omega\right)\circ\mathbf{x} & =\mathcal{L}_{\tilde{\mathbf{v}}}\left(\omega\circ\mathbf{x}\right)-\omega\circ\mathcal{L}_{\tilde{\mathbf{v}}}\mathbf{x}=\\

Alternatively, here is a geometric argument.
 We can construct a family of 3-surfaces 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma(\tau)$

 which are surfaces of constant affine parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$

 measured along orbits of

\begin_inset Formula $j=1,2,3$

\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathbf{c}_{j},\tilde{\mathbf{v}}\right]=0$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}_{j}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 and thus orthogonal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{v}}$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$

 These connecting vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}_{j}$

 will remain orthogonal to

 Therefore, the 3-surfaces 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma(\tau)$
\end_inset

 are everywhere orthogonal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{v}}$
\end_inset

 and thus also to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$

 Now consider the case of a Killing field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{k}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\omega\equiv\hat{g}\mathbf{k}$
\end_inset

.
 It is sufficient to prove that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{k}}(\omega\wedge\textrm{d}\omega)=0$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{k}$
\end_inset

 is a Killing vector, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{k}}g=0$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{k}}\omega=\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{k}}\hat{g}\mathbf{k}=\hat{g}\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{k}}\mathbf{k}=0.\]

\end_inset

We again recall that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}$
\end_inset

 commutes with 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{k}}\left(\omega\wedge\textrm{d}\omega\right)=\omega\wedge\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{k}}\textrm{d}\omega=\omega\wedge\textrm{d}\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{k}}\omega=0.\]

In summary, we have the following relationships between integrability, hypersurf

 The condition for hypersurface orthogonality, 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\wedge\textrm{d}\omega=0$
\end_inset

, is weaker than the condition for integrability, 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\omega=0$
\end_inset

.
 An integrable field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}=\hat{g}^{-1}(\textrm{d}f)$

 An integrable field

\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{n})=0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 We shall now study the geometry of null surfaces since they have certain
 special and useful properties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One unusual fact is that the normal vector is at the same time 
\emph on
tangent
\emph default
 to the null surface since 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{n})=0$
\end_inset

.
 The tangent space to a null surface is thus spanned by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 and two other basis vectors.
 The latter two vectors must be orthogonal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

, and thus both must be spacelike.
 In fact, all the tangent vectors that are not parallel to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 are spacelike (see the Statement\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{par:Exercise:-Properties-of-null-vectors}

\end_inset

).
 Thus, a null surface is spanned by the null direction 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 and two spacelike directions orthogonal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the tangent space contains its normal vector, the induced metric in
 the tangent space is 
\emph on
degenerate
\emph default
 since the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 is orthogonal to every vector in the tangent space.
 This leads to an ambiguity of the induced Levi-Civita connection on the
 null surface: The formula\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:LC connection ans}

\end_inset

), which is the only constraint on the Levi-Civita connection, does not
 define the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 uniquely through its scalar product with an arbitrary vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{z}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus there are many possible Levi-Civita connections on a null surface.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another peculiarity is that there is no unique projector onto the tangent
 space (see Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Orthogonal-complements}

\end_inset

 A satisfactory projector\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:null projector}

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{l}$

The simplest example of a null surface is the null cone of lightrays emitted
 from a point.
 Let us describe this surface explicitly in a flat Minkowski spacetime.
 The lightcone emitted at the origin is specified by the equation
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
t-r\equiv t-\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}}=0.\label{eq:Minkowski lightcone}\end{equation}

\end_inset

The vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 normal to this surface is
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{n}=\frac{\partial}{\partial t}+\frac{x}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}+\frac{y}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial y}+\frac{z}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial z}.\]

\end_inset

It is easy to check that 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{n})=0$
\end_inset

.
 The tangent space to the lightcone at a point 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(t,x,y,z\right)$
\end_inset

 is spanned by the null vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 and the two spacelike vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial/\partial\phi$

\begin_inset Formula $\partial/\partial\theta$

\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta} & =\frac{z}{r}\left(x\frac{\partial}{\partial x}+y\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right)-\frac{x^{2}+y^{2}}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial z}.\end{align*}

Another example of a null surface is the horizon of a nonrotating, spherically

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{Schwarzschild spacetime}

 It is well known that the black hole horizon is the surface 
\begin_inset Formula $r-2m=0$
\end_inset

.
 However, it is not easy to analyze vectors at 
\begin_inset Formula $r=2m$
\end_inset

 since the Schwarzschild coordinates are singular there.
 To show that the horizon surface is null, we note that its tangent space
 is spanned by the two spacelike vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial/\partial\phi$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial/\partial\theta$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}$
\end_inset

 which is null at 
\begin_inset Formula $r=2m$
\end_inset

 (but not at other values of 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

).
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial/\partial t$
\end_inset

 is null, it is also the normal vector to the surface and hence the surface
 is null.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We first note that in the immediate vicinity of the initial point 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$

 the lightcone can be viewed, in suitable local coordinates, as a portion
 of the Minkowski lightcone\InsetSpace ~

 Thus the tangent space in the vicinity of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$

 is indeed spanned by one null vector and two spacelike vectors orthogonal

 We now need to extend this property away from the initial point

\begin_layout Standard
By assumption, the lightcone surface is built 
\emph on
entirely
\emph default
 from the congruence of lightrays emitted at 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 Translating this assumption into the mathematical language, we say that
 every point on the surface lies on some lightray from the congruence, and
 thus the surface can be parametrically described by a function 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\gamma(\tau;s_{1},s_{2}):\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}\rightarrow M\]

\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau;s_{1},s_{2})$
\end_inset

 is a lightray for fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 (Note that there is a two-dimensional sphere of initial directions for
 emitting the lightrays, hence two parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{1,2}$
\end_inset

.) In particular
\series bold
, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}=\partial\gamma/\partial\tau$

is the tangent vector field which is null, and the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{1}\equiv\partial\tau/\partial s_{1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{2}\equiv\partial\tau/\partial s_{2}$
\end_inset

 are everywhere linearly independent, connecting vectors for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 (see the Statement\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \pageref{par:Exercise:-Connecting-vectors.}

 Thus we have the properties
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{n}) & =0,\quad\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}\mathbf{n}=0,\\
\left[\mathbf{n},\mathbf{u}_{1}\right] & =\left[\mathbf{n},\mathbf{u}_{2}\right]=0.\end{align*}

\end_inset

 By construction, the connecting vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{1,2}$
\end_inset

 are always tangent to the surface, and so is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{u}_{1},\mathbf{u}_{2}\right)$
\end_inset

 are always a basis in the tangent space to the surface.
 The vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 is everywhere null by assumption, so it remains to show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{2}$
\end_inset

 remain spacelike throughout the surface, at any point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Minkowski description of the lightcone holds for an infinitesimal vicinity
 of

\end_inset

 near 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$

 Then it follows from Lemma\InsetSpace ~

 everywhere along the orbits of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$

 Vectors orthogonal to a null vector and not parallel to it must be spacelike
 (see Statement\InsetSpace ~

 Since each point

some

\begin_layout Standard
The null tangent vector

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$

 Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$

 is orthogonal to every vector in the entire 3-dimensional tangent space,
 which means that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$

 is the normal vector to the surface.

Null functions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A null surface can be defined through an equation

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{null function}

\end_inset

More generally, a null function 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu(p)$
\end_inset

 on the spacetime is any function such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\nu$
\end_inset

 is a null covector, 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{-1}(\textrm{d}\nu,\textrm{d}\nu)=0$
\end_inset

 Immediate examples are the functions 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\nu(t,x,y,z) & =t-r\equiv t-\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}},\\
\textrm{or }\,\nu(t,x,y,z) & =t-x,\end{align*}

\end_inset

in the Minkowski spacetime (verify this!).
 A null function 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu(p)$
\end_inset

 defines a null hypersurface 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu(p)=\nu_{0}$
\end_inset

 for each value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu_{0}$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A null function can be physically interpreted as a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

retarded time
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 carried by lightrays emitted by some sources: If a lightray reaches an
 event 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

, it was emitted at the time 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu(p)$
\end_inset

 at its source.
 (Here we do not assume that all the rays are emitted by one and the same
 source.) To remember this more easily, recall that time stands still for
 an observer moving at lightspeed, so a lightray 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

preserves
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 its emission time and shows it at a point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 as the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu(p)$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A peculiar property of null functions 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu(p)$

 is that the normal vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}=\hat{g}^{-1}(\textrm{d}\nu)$
\end_inset

 is tangent to the surface of constant 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

.
 Thus a null surface 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu(p)=\nu_{0}$
\end_inset

 naturally comes with a congruence of null lines, which are the orbits of
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 within the surface and the null generators of the surface.

\begin_layout Subsection
Null functions generate null geodesics

\begin_layout Standard
The usefulness of null functions comes from the fact that any null surface
 consists not just of some null lines, but actually of 
\emph on
null geodesics
\emph default
 (see the following statement).
 These geodesics are the null generators of the surface.
 Since any null surface is a surface 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu(p)=\nu_{0}$
\end_inset

 for some null function 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$
\end_inset

, it will follow that null functions provide a complete description of any
 null surface consisting of lightrays.

 is a null function with the normal vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 are null geodesics.
 More generally, if a null curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)$
\end_inset

 is contained within a surface 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu(p)=\textrm{const}$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)$
\end_inset

 is a null geodesic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A stronger statement was proved in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Integrable-vector-fields}

\end_inset

: If 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 is integrable and 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{n})=\textrm{const}$
\end_inset

, where the constant is not necessarily zero, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}\mathbf{n}=0$
\end_inset

.
 We shall give a direct derivation that does not use forms.
 To show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}\mathbf{n}=0$
\end_inset

, we shall prove that 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{x},\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}\mathbf{n})=0$
\end_inset

 for an arbitrary vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

.
 We compute
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
g(\mathbf{x},\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}\mathbf{n}) & =\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{n})-g(\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}\mathbf{x},\mathbf{n})\\
 & =\mathbf{n}\circ g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{n})-g(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{n}+[\mathbf{n},\mathbf{x}],\mathbf{n}).\end{align*}

\end_inset

(We have used torsion-freeness and compatibility of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla$
\end_inset

 with the metric.) Since by assumption 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{n})=\textrm{const}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}=\hat{g}^{-1}\textrm{d}\nu$
\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{n},\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{n})=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{n})=\mathbf{x}\circ\nu$
\end_inset

 [see also Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:def of n}

\end_inset

)].
 Thus we find
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
g(\mathbf{x},\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}\mathbf{n}) & =\mathbf{n}\circ g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{n})-g([\mathbf{n},\mathbf{x}],\mathbf{n})\\
 & =\mathbf{n}\circ(\mathbf{x}\circ\nu)-([\mathbf{n},\mathbf{x}])\circ\nu=\mathbf{x}\circ(\mathbf{n}\circ\nu)\\
 & =\mathbf{x}\circ g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{n})=0.\end{align*}

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It follows that the orbits of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 are geodesics for integrable null 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

.
 A tangent space to a null surface contains only one null direction, and
 that direction is parallel to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

.
 So any null curve contained within the surface must be an orbit of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 and hence a geodesic.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Statement:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For any null geodesic curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)$
\end_inset

 there exists a null function 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu(p)$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}=\hat{g}^{-1}(\textrm{d}\nu)$
\end_inset

 on the curve, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)$
\end_inset

 is a null generator of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu(p)=0$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are of course many possible null functions satisfying this condition.
 We shall construct one such null function 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu(p)$
\end_inset

 by choosing an arbitrary timelike curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta$
\end_inset

 intersecting 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 at a point 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 This curve will be the worldline of a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

light source.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Suppose that the source emits lightrays in all directions from each point
 of the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta$
\end_inset

, and that 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)$
\end_inset

 is one of these lightrays emitted from 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 is a suitable parameter on the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(\sigma)$
\end_inset

, such that the tangent vector is normalized, 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\dot{\boldsymbol{\zeta}},\dot{\boldsymbol{\zeta}})=1$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 is the observer's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

proper time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 measured along the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(\sigma)$
\end_inset

.
 We may suppose that the point 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$
\end_inset

 corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=0$
\end_inset

.
 Then we define the desired null function 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu(p)$
\end_inset

 as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

retarded time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 carried by the lightrays from the source.
 More precisely, we define 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu(p)=\sigma$
\end_inset

 if the point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is intersected by a lightray emitted from the point 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta(\sigma)$
\end_inset

.
 For instance, we then have 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu(p_{0})=0$
\end_inset

.
 The function 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu(p)$
\end_inset

 is well-defined in some neighborhood of the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta$
\end_inset

; more precisely, in a neighborhood where the lightcones are well-behaved,
 i.e.\InsetSpace ~
do not form caustics and fill the entire space around the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta$
\end_inset

, leaving no gaps.
 By construction, the function 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu(p)$
\end_inset

 is constant along 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)$
\end_inset

 and thus the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)$
\end_inset

 lies within the surface 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu(p)=0$
\end_inset

, and the null vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 is everywhere tangent to the surface 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu(p)=0$
\end_inset

.
 It remains to show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu(p)$
\end_inset

 is a null function; this is so because 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu(p)=\textrm{const}$
\end_inset

 is by construction a lightcone surface, and we have already proved that
 any lightcone surface is null.

\begin_layout Subsection
Conformal invariance 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Under a conformal transformation of the metric, 
\begin_inset Formula $g\rightarrow\tilde{g}=e^{2\lambda}g$
\end_inset

, null vectors obviously remain null.
 Therefore null functions remain null under a conformal transformation (i.e.\InsetSpace ~
they
 are conformally invariant).
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{conformal invariance}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also, shapes of null geodesics are conformally invariant: a null geodesic
 line 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)$
\end_inset

 remains a geodesic after a conformal transformation of the metric.
 This statement is now very easy to prove: a null geodesic is always an
 orbit of a gradient of some null function 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu(p)$
\end_inset

, the gradient operation 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 is independent of the metric, and so the property of being a null function
 is conformally invariant.
 It follows that the normal vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}\equiv\hat{g}^{-1}(\textrm{d}\nu)$
\end_inset

 will change to 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{n}}=e^{-2\lambda}\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

, and thus the orbits of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{n}}$
\end_inset

 are the same as those of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 The affine parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$

 must of course be changed, but the shape of the lines will remain the same.

 The distortion satisfies a purely kinematical relation called the Raychaudhuri

 We have seen in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Divergence-of-a}

\end_inset

 that the divergence 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{div}\mathbf{u}$

 of a vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 measures the relative rate of change of infinitesimal volume transported
 by the flow of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 Consider an small region of space around a point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 region).
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{comoving region}

\end_inset

 This region can be visualized as consisting of a number of small, noninteractin
g particles, each moving along its flow line.
 The region will be generally distorted by the flow, so that not only its
 volume but also its shape will change.
 The distortion of the shape is measured by tensors called the shear and
 the rotation, which we shall now introduce.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The shape of the comoving region is naturally characterized by connecting
 vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$

 For convenience, we can choose 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 to be orthogonal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 at the initial point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 It then follows from Lemma\InsetSpace ~
1 in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Lightcones-are-null}

\end_inset

 that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 remains orthogonal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$

 along the orbits of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There would be no distortion of the region if every connecting vector

 Of course, in general we expect that 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{c}\neq0$
\end_inset

 at least for some 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, the distortion of the volume around the point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 during an infinitesimal time will be described by the derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 along the flow.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{c}=\nabla_{\mathbf{c}}\mathbf{u},\]

\end_inset

the quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 is a linear function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 that can be described by a 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$

\begin_inset Formula $B(\mathbf{u})$

\end_inset

In components,
\begin_inset Formula \[
B_{\alpha}^{\beta}=\nabla_{\alpha}u^{\beta}\equiv u_{\:;\alpha}^{\beta}.\]

\end_inset

The transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $B(\mathbf{u})$
\end_inset

 can be also written as
\begin_inset Formula \[
B(\mathbf{u})=\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}-\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{v}},\]

\end_inset

where it is implied that both sides act on a vector field.

\end_inset

Even if the divergence is zero, but

\end_inset

 To analyze the information provided by

 It is easy to see from Eq.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset Formula \[

\begin_inset Formula $\omega$

 is the 1-form dual to the vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 The rotation tensor

\end_inset

 is thus the analog of the familiar three-dimensional curl (rotation) 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla\times\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 of a vector field.
 A nonzero rotation means that the vector field is not a potential field;
 in our terminology, a nonzero 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{(\mathbf{u})}$
\end_inset

 means that the field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$

To visualize the shape distortion represented by a nonzero

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$

 is timelike and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{(\mathbf{u})}$
\end_inset

 is a constant tensor, represented by a constant antisymmetric matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{\alpha\beta}$

 in an orthogonal basis.
 Denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{r}_{(\mathbf{u})}$
\end_inset

 the transformation corresponding to the 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{(\mathbf{u})}$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 we have
\begin_inset Formula \[
g(\hat{r}_{(\mathbf{u})}\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=r_{(\mathbf{u})}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}).\]

\end_inset

 For simplicity, suppose that the symmetric part of the distortion tensor
 vanishes, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{B}_{(\mathbf{u})}=0$

 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $B(\mathbf{u})=\hat{r}_{(\mathbf{u})}$

 satisfies the equation
\begin_inset Formula \[

\end_inset

with the solution 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{c}(\tau)=\exp\left(\tau\hat{r}_{(\mathbf{u})}\right)\mathbf{c}_{0}.\]

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{(\mathbf{u})}$
\end_inset

 is transverse to a timelike direction, it is represented (in an orthogonal

 The exponential of such a matrix is a

Introducing Raychaudhuri equation

\begin_layout Standard
The Raychaudhuri equation describes the change of the divergence of a geodesic
 vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 along its own orbits.
 We straightforwardly find
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}(\textrm{div}\mathbf{u}) & =\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})}\left(\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}B_{(\mathbf{u})}\right)\circ(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y});\\
\left(\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}B_{(\mathbf{u})}\right) & \circ(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\\
 & =\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\left(B_{(\mathbf{u})}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\right)-B_{(\mathbf{u})}(\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})-B_{(\mathbf{u})}(\mathbf{x},\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{y})\\
 & =\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}g(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{u},\mathbf{y})-g(\nabla_{\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{u},\mathbf{y})-g(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{u},\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{y}).\end{align*}

\end_inset

Using the metricity condition and the definition of the Riemann tensor,
 we rewrite the first and the third terms as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}g(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{u},\mathbf{y})-g(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{u},\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{y}) & =g(\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{u},\mathbf{y})\\
=R(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u},\mathbf{y})+g(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{u}, & \mathbf{y})+g(\nabla_{[\mathbf{u},\mathbf{x}]}\mathbf{u},\mathbf{y})\\
=R(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u},\mathbf{y})+g(\nabla_{[\mathbf{u},\mathbf{x}]}\mathbf{u}, & \mathbf{y});\end{align*}

\end_inset

finally,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\left(\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}B_{(\mathbf{u})}\right) & \circ(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\\
 & =R(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u},\mathbf{y})+g(\nabla_{[\mathbf{u},\mathbf{x}]}\mathbf{u},\mathbf{y})-g(\nabla_{\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{u},\mathbf{y})\\
 & =R(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u},\mathbf{y})-g(\nabla_{\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{u},\mathbf{y})\\
 & =R(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u},\mathbf{y})-g(B(\mathbf{u})B(\mathbf{u})\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}).\end{align*}

\end_inset

The trace of the last expression with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 yields 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}(\textrm{div}\mathbf{u})=\textrm{Ric}(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{u})-\textrm{Tr}\left(B(\mathbf{u})B(\mathbf{u})\right),\label{eq:Raychaudhuri 0}\end{equation}

\end_inset

At this point we can use the decomposition\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:B decomp 1}

) which separates the symmetric and the antisymmetric parts of the distortion
 tensor.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{Tr}\left(AB\right)$
\end_inset

 is a nondegenerate scalar product in the linear space of square matrices.
 The subspaces of symmetric and antisymmetric matrices are orthogonal with
 respect to this scalar product.
 (Verify this!) Therefore with the decomposition 
\begin_inset Formula $B=\tilde{B}+r$
\end_inset

 the trace 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{Tr}(B^{2})$
\end_inset

 is simplified to
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{Tr}\left(B(\mathbf{u})B(\mathbf{u})\right)=\textrm{Tr}\left(\tilde{B}(\mathbf{u})\tilde{B}(\mathbf{u})\right)+\textrm{Tr}\left(\hat{r}_{(\mathbf{u})}\hat{r}_{(\mathbf{u})}\right),\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{r}_{(\mathbf{u})}$
\end_inset

 is the transformation associated with the 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{(\mathbf{u})}$
\end_inset

 If the vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$

\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{B}$

for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$

 This fact allows us to reduce 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{(\mathbf{u})}$
\end_inset

 to a bilinear form in a lower-dimensional space.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First we decompose the tangent space 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{p}\mathcal{M}$

 into the subspace 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}^{\perp}$
\end_inset

 and its complement, the one-dimensional space spanned by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 This decomposition is conveniently expressed using a projector 
\begin_inset Formula $P$

 onto 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}^{\perp}$
\end_inset

 and a complementary projector 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$

\end_inset

The contravariant metric is correspondingly decomposed as
\begin_inset Formula \[

A bilinear form

\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 as follows:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}

\end_inset

 So far we have not obtained any new information about 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 However, if the form 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 is transverse to the direction of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $B(\cdot,Q\mathbf{y})=0$
\end_inset

, and the above formula simplifies to
\begin_inset Formula \[
B(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=B(P\mathbf{x},P\mathbf{y}).\]

\end_inset

Since the structure of the projectors crucially depends on whether the vector
 field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 is null, we must consider the relevant cases separately.
 In this section we treat the easier case when 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 is timelike.
 (The spacelike case is very similar but less important in practice.) Assuming
 that 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{u})=1$

\begin_inset Formula \[
P\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{u}g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u}),\quad Q\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{u}g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u}).\]

\end_inset

The distortion tensor is effectively three-dimensional since it is nonzero
 only on the subspace 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}^{\perp}$
\end_inset

, where it coincides with its projection, denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{(\mathbf{u})}^{\perp}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula \[
B_{(\mathbf{u})}^{\perp}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\equiv B_{(\mathbf{u})}(P\mathbf{x},P\mathbf{y})=B_{(\mathbf{u})}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}).\]

 It is convenient to express the shear using the partial metric for the

Note that the partial signature of this metric is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(---\right)$

 and its trace is equal to 3.
 If a symmetric bilinear form 
\begin_inset Formula $T(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$
\end_inset

 is nonzero only on the subspace

\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is expressed as 
\begin_inset Formula \[

 Since

\end_inset

(

 Note that every term in that decomposition is transverse to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$

 It is important that this subspace has a metric 
\begin_inset Formula $h$

 with a Euclidean signature; the overall minus sign of 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 is unimportant for the present consideration.
 The partial metric 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 establishes a correspondence between bilinear forms and transformations,
 and we shall denote transformations by a hat.
 For example, the bilinear form

 Both these subspaces are also orthogonal to the subspace of antisymmetric

 Therefore we can decompose the trace term as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{Tr}\left(B(\mathbf{u})B(\mathbf{u})\right)=\frac{1}{3}\left(\textrm{Tr }B(\mathbf{u})\right)^{2}+\textrm{Tr}\left(\hat{\sigma}_{(\mathbf{u})}\hat{\sigma}_{(\mathbf{u})}\right)+\textrm{Tr}\left(\hat{r}_{(\mathbf{u})}\hat{r}_{(\mathbf{u})}\right).\]

The Raychaudhuri equation for timelike geodesics is then written as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}(\textrm{div}\mathbf{u}) & =\textrm{Ric}(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{u})-\frac{1}{3}(\textrm{div}\mathbf{u})^{2}\\

 We can demonstrate this fact formally by computing
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})}h(\hat{\sigma}\hat{\sigma}\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}) & \equiv\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})}\sigma(\hat{\sigma}\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})}\sigma(\mathbf{y},\hat{\sigma}\mathbf{x})\\

\begin_inset Formula $B_{(\mathbf{n})}$
\end_inset

 using the projectors 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

, analogously to Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Bxy decomp 1}

\end_inset

).
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{(\mathbf{n})}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{n})=0$
\end_inset

 by transversality, we can write 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
B_{(\mathbf{n})}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}) & =B_{(\mathbf{n})}(P\mathbf{x},P\mathbf{y})+B_{(\mathbf{n})}(P\mathbf{x},\mathbf{l})g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{y})\\
 & +B_{(\mathbf{n})}(\mathbf{l},P\mathbf{y})g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{x})+B_{(\mathbf{n})}(\mathbf{l},\mathbf{l})g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{x})g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{y}).\end{align*}

\end_inset

The first term, 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{(\mathbf{n})}(P\mathbf{x},P\mathbf{y})\equiv B_{(\mathbf{n})}^{\perp}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$
\end_inset

, is effectively a bilinear form on a two-dimensional space spanned by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}_{1},\mathbf{s}_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Note that the trace of 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{(\mathbf{n})}^{\perp}$
\end_inset

 is equal to the trace of 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{(\mathbf{n})}$
\end_inset

.
 This can be seen formally by using the general property 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})}g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{n})A(\mathbf{y},...)=A(\mathbf{n},...);\]

\end_inset

in other words, a trace with 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 substitutes 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 into the rest of the expression.
 However, substituting 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 into any term yields zero since 
\begin_inset Formula $P\mathbf{n}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{n})=0$
\end_inset

.
 For instance, 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})}g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{n})g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{y}) & =g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{n})=0,\\
\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})}B_{(\mathbf{n})}(P\mathbf{x},\mathbf{l})g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{y}) & =B_{(\mathbf{n})}(P\mathbf{n},\mathbf{l})=0.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Therefore
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{Tr }B_{(\mathbf{n})}^{\perp}=\textrm{div}\mathbf{n}.\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we compute the trace needed for the Raychaudhuri equation,
\begin_inset Formula \[

\end_inset

it turns out that all the terms vanish except the term 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{Tr }B_{(\mathbf{n})}^{\perp}B_{(\mathbf{n})}^{\perp}$

\begin_layout Paragraph
Remark:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For null congruences 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

, the reduction of the distortion tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{(\mathbf{n})}$
\end_inset

 to its transverse 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{(\mathbf{n})}^{\perp}$
\end_inset

 can be also motivated as follows.
 The distortion tensor describes the change of shape in the comoving 2-volume
 spanned by two spacelike connecting vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}_{1,2}$
\end_inset

.
 It is clear that these connecting vectors should be orthogonal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Also, connecting vectors could be changed by adding a multiple of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

, e.g.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}_{1}\rightarrow\mathbf{s}_{1}+\lambda\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is a scalar function; this will not modify the orthogonality of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}_{1,2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset


\series default
.
 However, connecting vectors that differ only by a multiple of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 correspond to a change of the parameter in nearby curves of the congruence.
 Therefore, the connecting vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}+\lambda\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 carry the same information about the geometry of the congruence.
 Thus we should only consider equivalence classes of connecting vectors
 up to a multiple of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

.
 While there is no canonical choice of representatives for these equivalence
 classes, a relatively straightforward way is to choose 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}_{1,2}$
\end_inset

 within a 2-plane orthogonal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 and an auxiliary null vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{l}$

 This is the construction used in the present section.

\sigma_{(\mathbf{n})}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}) & \equiv\frac{1}{2}\left(B_{(\mathbf{n})}^{\perp}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})+B_{(\mathbf{n})}^{\perp}(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{x})\right)-\frac{1}{2}(\textrm{div}\mathbf{n})h_{\mathbf{n}},\\
r_{(\mathbf{n})}^{\perp}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}) & \equiv r_{(\mathbf{n})}(P\mathbf{x},P\mathbf{y})=\frac{1}{2}\left(B_{(\mathbf{n})}^{\perp}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})-B_{(\mathbf{n})}^{\perp}(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{x})\right).\end{align*}

\end_inset

Note the factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{3}$
\end_inset

, which is due to the projector 
\begin_inset Formula $P$

 being two-dimensional.
 The Raychaudhuri equation for null geodesics is then written as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}

 The value of the vector

The divergence 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{div}\mathbf{u}$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 can be interpreted as the relative rate of change of a comoving 3-volume
 orthogonal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 This is so because the 3-volume spanned by vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c}$

 is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c},\mathbf{x})$

 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 are connecting vectors for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 which are orthogonal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$

 Thus
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{dV}{d\tau}=\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{u}}\varepsilon(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c},\mathbf{u})=\left(\textrm{div}\mathbf{u}\right)\varepsilon(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c},\mathbf{u})=\left(\textrm{div}\mathbf{u}\right)V.\]

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a congruence of timelike geodesics such that the tangent vector
 field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 is hypersurface orthogonal.
 Then, as we have seen, the rotation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 vanishes, and the distortion tensor is symmetric.
 The Raychaudhuri equation is simplified to
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{d}{d\tau}(\textrm{div}\mathbf{u})=R(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{u})-\frac{1}{3}(\textrm{div}\mathbf{u})^{2}-\textrm{Tr}\left(\hat{\sigma}_{(\mathbf{u})}\hat{\sigma}_{(\mathbf{u})}\right).\]

\end_inset

Imposing the strong energy condition, which holds for classical matter,
 we find that the right-hand side of the above equation is nonpositive,
 indicating that gravity makes hypersurface-orthogonal geodesics diverge
 less.
 This means that gravity is an attractive force.
 In fact, we can obtain a stronger result,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{d}{d\tau}(\textrm{div}\mathbf{u})\leq-\frac{1}{3}(\textrm{div}\mathbf{u})^{2}.\]

\end_inset

This inequality can be integrated with an initial value 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{div}\mathbf{u}(\tau_{0})=\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

, which yields
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{div}\mathbf{u}\leq\frac{1}{\theta_{0}^{-1}+\frac{1}{3}\tau}.\]

\end_inset

If the initial value 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

 is positive, the divergence goes to zero (or becomes negative), and if
 it is initially negative, it diverges to negative infinity within a finite
 time.
 A negative infinite divergence means that the geodesics cross at a 
\series bold

 The set of all focal points in a given congruence is called a

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{caustic}

\end_inset

 We conclude that the appearance of a focal point is inevitable within a

 for hypersurface orthogonal geodesic congruences.
 This statement is known as the

\begin_layout Standard
A congruence of timelike geodesics emitted from one point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$

\begin_inset Formula $\tau$

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 be the affine tangent vector field for a congruence of geodesics emitted
 from 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 We may normalize 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{u})=1$
\end_inset

.
 Since there are three linearly independent connecting vectors for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 at any point, and since these connecting vectors form a basis of the tangent
 space to a hypersurface of constant 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, it is sufficient to show that 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 connecting vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 is everywhere orthogonal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

.
 It will then follow that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 is orthogonal to the hypersurface of constant 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
 Now, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 is a connecting vector for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

, it is easy to show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}g(\mathbf{c},\mathbf{u})=0$
\end_inset

 (see Lemma\InsetSpace ~
1 in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Lightcones-are-null}

\end_inset

).
 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{c},\mathbf{u})$
\end_inset

 is constant along the lines of the congruence, and so it remains to show
 that 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{c},\mathbf{u})=0$
\end_inset

 at any one point along each line.
 Since obviously all connecting vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 must vanish at the point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{c},\mathbf{u})=0$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 for every line of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

.
 (Alternatively, we may consider an infinitesimal neighborhood of 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

, where the geometry of lines is approximately the same as in the Minkowski
 space, where geodesics are straight lines and the statement 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{c},\mathbf{u})=0$
\end_inset

 is obviously true.) Thus we have proved the statement.

\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{div}\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 describes the rate of change of comoving area.
 Secondly, the rotation tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{(\mathbf{n})}$
\end_inset

 generally does not vanish for hypersurface-orthogonal null geodesics.
 However, Raychaudhuri equation involves the trace term 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{Tr }(r_{(\mathbf{n})}r_{(\mathbf{n})})$
\end_inset

, and we shall now show that this term vanishes for a hypersurface-orthogonal
 field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

, even though the rotation tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{(\mathbf{n})}$
\end_inset

 itself does not vanish.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have seen in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Shear-for-null}

\end_inset

 that the trace terms involve only the projected distortion tensor [Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:trace of projected distortion}

\end_inset

)].
 Therefore the trace term will remain the same after we project the rotation
 tensor onto the subspace spanned by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}_{1,2}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{Tr }\left(r_{(\mathbf{n})}r_{(\mathbf{n})}\right)=\textrm{Tr }\left(r_{(\mathbf{n})}^{\perp}r_{(\mathbf{n})}^{\perp}\right).\]

\end_inset

 We now use the fact that the rotation 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{(\mathbf{n})}$
\end_inset

 is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $d\omega$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\equiv\hat{g}^{-1}\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 is the 1-form dual to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

.
 By the assumption of hypersurface orthogonality and the Frobenius theorem,
 there exist scalar functions 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda,\nu$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega=e^{\lambda}\textrm{d}\nu$
\end_inset

 and then 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{d}\omega=e^{\lambda}\textrm{d}\lambda\wedge\textrm{d}\nu=\textrm{d}\lambda\wedge\omega.\]

\end_inset

The projected rotation tensor acts on vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
r_{(\mathbf{n})}^{\perp}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}) & \equiv(\textrm{d}\omega)\circ(P\mathbf{x},P\mathbf{y})\\
 & =\omega(P\mathbf{y})(\textrm{d}\lambda)\circ P\mathbf{x}-\omega(P\mathbf{x})(\textrm{d}\lambda)\circ P\mathbf{y}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega(P\mathbf{x})=0$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{(\mathbf{n})}^{\perp}=0$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the projected rotation vanishes, we obtain the Raychaudhuri equation
 for null geodesics in the form
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{d}{d\tau}(\textrm{div}\mathbf{n})=R(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{n})-\frac{1}{2}(\textrm{div}\mathbf{n})^{2}-\textrm{Tr}\left(\hat{\sigma}_{(\mathbf{n})}\hat{\sigma}_{(\mathbf{n})}\right).\]

\end_inset

Imposing the null energy condition, we find 
\begin_inset Formula $R(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{n})\leq0$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, the right-hand side of the above equation is nonpositive and
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{d}{d\tau}(\textrm{div}\mathbf{n})\leq-\frac{1}{2}(\textrm{div}\mathbf{n})^{2}.\]

\end_inset

This is the focusing theorem 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{focusing theorem}

\end_inset

for the null case.
 The conclusion is that gravity makes null geodesics focus within a finite
 interval of the affine parameter

Null tetrad formalism
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:Null-tetrad-formalism}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The null tetrad formalism is due to Newman and Penrose and consists of writing
 equations in a basis where 
\emph on
all four
\emph default
 vectors are null and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

as orthogonal as possible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with respect to each other.
 This leads to simplifications when writing tensor equations in components.
 We shall now introduce the null tetrad formalism as an elegant way of expressin
g the projected distortion tensor for the case of null geodesics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idea is to change the previously used basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\mathbf{l},\mathbf{n},\mathbf{s}_{1},\mathbf{s}_{2}\}$
\end_inset

, where the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{l},\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 are null and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}_{1,2}$
\end_inset

 are spacelike connecting vectors for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

, into a null basis.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{l}$
\end_inset

 must satisfy 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{l},\mathbf{n})=1$
\end_inset

 and so 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{l}$
\end_inset

 is not (and generally cannot be chosen as) a connecting vector for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

, we are motivated to drop the requirement that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}_{1,2}$
\end_inset

 be connecting vectors but instead demand orthonormality, 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{s}_{j},\mathbf{s}_{k})=-\delta_{jk}$
\end_inset

.
 Then we define the 
\emph on
complex-valued
\emph default
 null vectors 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mathbf{m}\equiv\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\mathbf{s}_{1}+\text{i}\mathbf{s}_{2}\right),\quad\bar{\mathbf{m}}\equiv\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\mathbf{s}_{1}-\text{i}\mathbf{s}_{2}\right).\label{eq:m through s1s2}\end{equation}

\end_inset

The fact that these vectors are complex-valued is merely a mathematical
 formality that makes equations more compact; we expect that every physically
 measurable quantity is real-valued.
 The null basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\mathbf{l},\mathbf{n},\mathbf{m},\bar{\mathbf{m}}\}$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
The null tetrad is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

nearly orthogonal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 since 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{m},\bar{\mathbf{m}})=-1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{l},\mathbf{n})=1$
\end_inset

, and all the other scalar products vanish.
 Hence, the decomposition\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:g inverse decomp 1}

\end_inset

) of the contravariant metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{-1}$
\end_inset

 is rewritten through the null tetrad as
\begin_inset Formula \[
g^{-1}=\mathbf{l}\otimes\mathbf{n}+\mathbf{n}\otimes\mathbf{l}-\mathbf{m}\otimes\bar{\mathbf{m}}-\bar{\mathbf{m}}\otimes\mathbf{m}.\]

\end_inset

The partial metric 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{(\mathbf{n})}$
\end_inset

 is similarly decomposed as
\begin_inset Formula \[
h_{(\mathbf{n})}^{-1}=-\mathbf{m}\otimes\bar{\mathbf{m}}-\bar{\mathbf{m}}\otimes\mathbf{m},\]

\end_inset

and the projector 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula \[
P\mathbf{x}=-\mathbf{m}g(\mathbf{x},\bar{\mathbf{m}})-\bar{\mathbf{m}}g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{m}).\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the null tetrad decomposition above, the divergence of a hypersurface
 orthogonal null geodesic field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 can be written as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\textrm{div}\mathbf{n} & =\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})}B_{(\mathbf{n})}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\\
 & =B_{(\mathbf{n})}(\mathbf{l},\mathbf{n})+B_{(\mathbf{n})}(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{l})-B_{(\mathbf{n})}(\mathbf{m},\bar{\mathbf{m}})-B_{(\mathbf{n})}(\bar{\mathbf{m}},\mathbf{m})\\
 & =-2B_{(\mathbf{n})}(\mathbf{m},\bar{\mathbf{m}})\equiv-2g(\nabla_{\mathbf{m}}\mathbf{n},\bar{\mathbf{m}}),\end{align*}

\end_inset

because the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{(\mathbf{n})}$
\end_inset

 is transverse to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 and its projection onto the subspace spanned by 
\begin_inset Formula $(\mathbf{m},\bar{\mathbf{m}})$
\end_inset

 is rotation-free.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that for a geodesic field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 that is 
\emph on

\emph default
 hypersurface orthogonal, the quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $-2B_{(\mathbf{n})}(\mathbf{m},\bar{\mathbf{m}})$
\end_inset

 is complex-valued, and only its real part is actually equal to the divergence
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

.
 However, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

complex-valued divergence
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\theta\equiv-2B_{(\mathbf{n})}(\mathbf{m},\bar{\mathbf{m}})\]

\end_inset

 is still useful for the analysis of such cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other ingredient in the Raychaudhuri equation is the projected shear
 tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{(\mathbf{n})}^{\perp}$
\end_inset

, which can be expressed as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
\sigma_{(\mathbf{n})}^{\perp}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}) & =B_{(\mathbf{n})}(P\mathbf{x},P\mathbf{y})-\frac{1}{2}\left(\textrm{div}\mathbf{n}\right)h_{(\mathbf{n})}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\nonumber \\
 & =g(\bar{\mathbf{m}},\mathbf{x})g(\bar{\mathbf{m}},\mathbf{y})\sigma+g(\mathbf{m},\mathbf{x})g(\mathbf{m},\mathbf{y})\bar{\sigma}\label{eq:shear through sigma}\end{align}

\end_inset

through the auxiliary (complex-valued) scalar quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sigma\equiv B_{(\mathbf{n})}(\mathbf{m},\mathbf{m}),\]

\end_inset

also called the 
\series bold
scalar shear
\series default
.
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{scalar shear}

\end_inset

Another expression for the scalar shear is
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sigma\equiv g(\mathbf{m},\nabla_{\mathbf{m}}\mathbf{n})=g(\mathbf{m},\left[\mathbf{m},\mathbf{n}\right])+g(\mathbf{m},\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}\mathbf{m})=g(\mathbf{m},\left[\mathbf{m},\mathbf{n}\right]).\]

\end_inset

It follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{m}$
\end_inset

 cannot be a connecting vector for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 unless the shear vanishes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The completion of a given vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 to a null tetrad is of course not unique.
 Let us now investigate the freedom in the choice of the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{l},\mathbf{m}$
\end_inset

 and the resulting uncertainties in the distortion quantities 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma,\theta$
\end_inset

.
 The tetrad vectors are defined by the requirements 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{l},\mathbf{l})=g(\mathbf{m},\mathbf{m})=g(\mathbf{l},\mathbf{m})=0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{l})=-g(\mathbf{m},\bar{\mathbf{m}})=1$
\end_inset

.
 The vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{m}$
\end_inset

 is related by Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:m through s1s2}

\end_inset

) to an orthonormal basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}_{1,2}$
\end_inset

 in the space 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mathbf{l},\mathbf{n}\right)^{\perp}$
\end_inset

.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{l},\mathbf{n},\mathbf{s}_{1},\mathbf{s}_{2}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a basis; the set of transformations that preserve the orthonormality
 of the basis is the Lorentz group; so the admissible transformations of
 the tetrad vectors are precisely the subgroup of the Lorentz group that
 leaves the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 unchanged.
 Let us describe these transformations explicitly.
 Suppose that the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{m}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{l}$
\end_inset

 change to
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\mathbf{m} & \rightarrow\tilde{\mathbf{m}}=\alpha\mathbf{m}+\beta\mathbf{n}+\gamma\mathbf{l},\\
\mathbf{l} & \rightarrow\tilde{\mathbf{l}}=\lambda\mathbf{l}+\mu\mathbf{m}+\bar{\mu}\bar{\mathbf{m}}+\nu\mathbf{n},\end{align*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha,\beta,\gamma,\mu$
\end_inset

 are complex and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda,\nu$
\end_inset

 are real.
 Then it is straightforward to prove that the orthogonality relations 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\tilde{\mathbf{m}},\mathbf{n})=0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\tilde{\mathbf{m}},\tilde{\bar{\mathbf{m}}})=-1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\tilde{\mathbf{l}},\mathbf{n})=1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\tilde{\mathbf{l}},\tilde{\mathbf{m}})=0$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\tilde{\mathbf{l}},\tilde{\mathbf{l}})=0$
\end_inset

 require that 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\bar{\alpha}=1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=\bar{\mu}\alpha$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu=\mu\bar{\mu}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, the general form of an admissible transformation is 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
\mathbf{m} & \rightarrow\tilde{\mathbf{m}}=e^{\text{i}\phi}\mathbf{m}+A\mathbf{n},\label{eq:m replacement 1}\\
\mathbf{l} & \rightarrow\tilde{\mathbf{l}}=\mathbf{l}+e^{\text{i}\phi}\bar{A}\mathbf{m}+e^{-\text{i}\phi}A\bar{\mathbf{m}}+A\bar{A}\mathbf{n},\label{eq:l replacement 1}\end{align}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 are arbitrary scalar functions; note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is real-valued while 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is complex-valued.
 We can easily see that the distortion quantities change under this transformati
on as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\sigma\rightarrow\tilde{\sigma}=e^{2\text{i}\phi}\sigma,\quad\theta\rightarrow\tilde{\theta}=\theta.\label{eq:sigma theta transform}\end{equation}

It is useful to obtain closed-form equations for the divergence

 The Raychaudhuri equation 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{Raychaudhuri equation!in null tetrad formalism}

\end_inset

(for a hypersurface orthogonal, null, geodesic field

\frac{d}{d\tau}\theta\equiv\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}\theta=-\frac{1}{2}\theta^{2}+\textrm{Ric}(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{n})-2\sigma\bar{\sigma}.\]

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\bar{\sigma}$
\end_inset

 is invariant under the transformation\InsetSpace ~

Under some additional assumptions about the null tetrad, a similar equation

\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$

\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\frac{d}{d\tau}\sigma\equiv\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}\sigma=-\frac{\theta+\bar{\theta}}{2}\sigma+R(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{m},\mathbf{n},\mathbf{m}).\label{eq:shear equation}\end{equation}

\end_inset

We shall now derive this equation and detail the necessary assumptions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We need to compute the quantity
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}\sigma\equiv\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}B_{(\mathbf{n})}(\mathbf{m},\mathbf{m}) & \equiv\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}g(\nabla_{\mathbf{m}}\mathbf{n},\mathbf{m})\\
 & =g(\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}\nabla_{\mathbf{m}}\mathbf{n},\mathbf{m})+g(\nabla_{\mathbf{m}}\mathbf{n},\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}\mathbf{m}).\end{align*}

\end_inset

The appearance of nested covariant derivatives suggests that we introduce
 the Riemann tensor,
\begin_inset Formula \[
g(\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}\nabla_{\mathbf{m}}\mathbf{n},\mathbf{m})=R(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{m},\mathbf{n},\mathbf{m})+g(\nabla_{[\mathbf{n},\mathbf{m}]}\mathbf{n},\mathbf{m}).\]

\end_inset

(We used 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}\mathbf{n}=0$
\end_inset

.) Thus
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}\sigma=R(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{m},\mathbf{n},\mathbf{m})+g(\nabla_{[\mathbf{n},\mathbf{m}]}\mathbf{n},\mathbf{m})+g(\nabla_{\mathbf{m}}\mathbf{n},\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}\mathbf{m}).\label{eq:sigma pre 1}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 By virtue of the following obvious properties,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
g(\nabla_{\mathbf{m}}\mathbf{n},\mathbf{n}) & =0,\; g(\nabla_{\mathbf{m}}\mathbf{n},\mathbf{m})\equiv\sigma,\; g(\nabla_{\mathbf{m}}\mathbf{n},\bar{\mathbf{m}})\equiv-\frac{1}{2}\theta,\\
g(\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}\mathbf{m},\mathbf{n}) & =\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}g(\mathbf{m},\mathbf{n})-g(\mathbf{m},\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}\mathbf{n})=0,\; g(\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}\mathbf{m},\mathbf{m})=0,\end{align*}

\end_inset

we have
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\nabla_{\mathbf{m}}\mathbf{n} & =-\sigma\bar{\mathbf{m}}+\frac{1}{2}\theta\mathbf{m}+\alpha\mathbf{n},\\
\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}\mathbf{m} & =\zeta\mathbf{m}+\gamma\mathbf{n},\end{align*}

\end_inset

where we introduced unknown scalar functions
\begin_inset Formula \[
\alpha\equiv g(\nabla_{\mathbf{m}}\mathbf{n},\mathbf{l}),\;\zeta\equiv-g(\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}\mathbf{m},\bar{\mathbf{m}}),\;\gamma\equiv g(\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}\mathbf{m},\mathbf{l}).\]

\end_inset

 These constants depend on the completion of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 to a null tetrad and should not enter the final expression.
 Now we can straightforwardly evaluate:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
g(\nabla_{\mathbf{m}}\mathbf{n},\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}\mathbf{m}) & =\zeta\sigma,\\
\left[\mathbf{n},\mathbf{m}\right] & =\left(\zeta-\frac{1}{2}\theta\right)\mathbf{m}+\sigma\bar{\mathbf{m}}+(\gamma-\alpha)\mathbf{n},\\
g(\nabla_{[\mathbf{n},\mathbf{m}]}\mathbf{n},\mathbf{m}) & =B_{(\mathbf{n})}(\left[\mathbf{n},\mathbf{m}\right],\mathbf{m})\\
 & =\left(\zeta-\frac{1}{2}\theta\right)B_{(\mathbf{n})}(\mathbf{m},\mathbf{m})+\sigma B_{(\mathbf{n})}(\bar{\mathbf{m}},\mathbf{m})\\
 & =\left(\zeta-\frac{1}{2}\theta\right)\sigma-\frac{1}{2}\bar{\theta}\sigma.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Finally, Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:sigma pre 1}

\end_inset

) is rewritten as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}\sigma=R(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{m},\mathbf{n},\mathbf{m})-\frac{1}{2}(\theta+\bar{\theta})\sigma+2\zeta\sigma.\]

\end_inset

This equation still contains the function 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta\equiv-g(\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}\mathbf{m},\bar{\mathbf{m}})$
\end_inset

 that depends on the completion of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 to a null tetrad and is thus arbitrary.
 We would like to eliminate this ``gauge dependence.

\begin_inset Formula \[

If a spacetime contains a finite island of matter surrounded by an infinite

almost flat sufficiently far from the matter.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 For example, the metric\InsetSpace ~

 metric in spherical coordinates in the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $r\rightarrow\infty$

In this chapter we shall formulate and explore the property of

 in more detail.
 We begin by considering an easier case of stationary spacetimes.

Suppose a metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g$

 is given in coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x^{\mu}\right\} $
\end_inset

, and the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 are independent of one of the coordinates, say 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{1}$
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{x^{1}}$
\end_inset

 is a Killing vector 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{Killing vector}

\end_inset

for the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

; in other words, the flow of the vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{x^{1}}$
\end_inset

 leaves the metric invariant.
 Thus, Killing vectors provide a formalization of the concept of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

coordinate symmetry
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the metric.
 Using Killing vectors, the heuristic concept of a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

time-independent metric
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is made precise in the following way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A spacetime is called 
\series bold

if it possesses a timelike Killing vector field.
 The existence of such a vector field leads to many useful properties that
 we shall now explore.
 A stronger property is being

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a stationary spacetime, the orbits of the Killing vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{k}$
\end_inset

 can be seen as preferred worldlines along which the geometry does not change.
 It is useful to consider imaginary observers moving along these worldlines.
 These

\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mathbf{u}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{g(\mathbf{k},\mathbf{k})}}\mathbf{k}.\label{eq:def of stationary observer}\end{equation}

\end_inset

Stationary observers find that the geometry of the spacetime around them
 is the same at all times.
 However, these stationary observers are not necessarily geodesic observers,
 i.e.\InsetSpace ~
they are not necessarily freely falling.
 For example, an observer sitting at the surface of a nonrotating planet
 observers that the geometry is time-independent.
 This is a stationary observer who is, obviously, not freely falling.

In general, a Killing vector is not normalized, so stationary worldlines

 observers rather than to freely falling observers.
 For example, the stationary worldlines in the Schwarzschild spacetime describe
 observers remaining at a constant distance from the center of mass.
 These observers move with a constant acceleration and thus feel a constant
 pull of gravity.
 Accordingly, the Killing vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{t}$

\begin_layout Standard
In the framework of General Relativity, the

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{Newtonian limit of GR}

\end_inset

is the assumption that gravitation is weak and that there exists a globally
 inertial reference frame---the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

absolute spacetime.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 In other words, a Newtonian setting considers a set of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

absolute
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 observers who see each other as motionless or moving with constant velocities
 at all times.
 (Of course, this assumption is only 
\emph on
approximately
\emph default
 correct in the actual curved spacetime; also the clocks at different points
 run at different rates and cannot be exactly synchronized everywhere at
 all times.) For example, someone sitting on the surface of the Earth could
 be such an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

absolute
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 observer.
 Since 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

absolute
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 observers do not necessarily move along geodesic lines, they will perceive
 the motion of freely falling bodies as an 
\emph on
accelerated
\emph default
 motion occurring in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

absolute
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 reference frame.
 The Newtonian theory explains this apparently accelerated motion as being
 due to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

gravitational forces.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 We now formalize these assumptions and derive the Newtonian equations of
 gravitation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A congruence of the world-lines of the

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})=1$
\end_inset

 The observers measure the

absolute time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 along the orbits of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
 The central assumption of the Newtonian limit is that these observers are
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

fixed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with respect to each other, so any neighbor observers appear to move without
 relative acceleration.
 In other words,

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$

\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathbf{c},\mathbf{v}\right]=0$

\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{c}\approx0$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us find out how the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

stationary
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 observers perceive the motion of freely falling (geodesic) particles.
 If a geodesic has instantaneously the same tangent vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 as one of the fixed observers, the observer's acceleration relative to
 the geodesic is 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

, therefore the observer will measure the acceleration of the freely falling
 particle as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\equiv-\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
 Our goal is to derive a formula describing the acceleration 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The plan of the derivation is the following.
 First we use the properties of connecting vectors to deduce that the vector
 field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 is integrable.
 It will follow that there exists a scalar function 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}=\hat{g}^{-1}\textrm{d}\phi$
\end_inset

.
 This scalar function is called the 
\series bold
gravitational potential
\series default
.
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{gravitational potential}

\end_inset

 Then we shall derive an equation for 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

, using the Einstein equation with matter sources consisting of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fixed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 matter (not moving with respect to the fixed observers) with mass density
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(x)$
\end_inset

.
 This equation will coincide with the (three-dimensional) Poisson equation
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\phi=4\pi\rho$
\end_inset

, which is equivalent to Newton's law of gravity.
 In this way we reproduce the Newtonian theory of gravitation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The acceleration field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 is integrable if the bilinear form 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{(\mathbf{a})}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$
\end_inset

 defined by Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Bv def}

\end_inset

) is symmetric.
 The form of the expression 
\begin_inset Formula \[
B_{(\mathbf{a})}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\equiv-g(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{v},\mathbf{y})\]

\end_inset

suggests that we should consider the combination
\begin_inset Formula \[
g(\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{v}-\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{v}-\nabla_{\left[\mathbf{v},\mathbf{x}\right]}\mathbf{v},\mathbf{y})=R(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{v},\mathbf{y})\]

\end_inset

and try to simplify it using the given information about the connecting
 vectors.
 We substitute 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 and obtain
\begin_inset Formula \[
0=g(\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{c},\mathbf{y})=g(\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\nabla_{\mathbf{c}}\mathbf{v},\mathbf{y})=R(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{c},\mathbf{v},\mathbf{y})+g(\nabla_{\mathbf{c}}\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{v},\mathbf{y})\]

\end_inset

and therefore
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
B_{(\mathbf{a})}(\mathbf{c},\mathbf{y})\equiv-g(\nabla_{\mathbf{c}}\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{v},\mathbf{y})=R(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{c},\mathbf{v},\mathbf{y}).\label{eq:Ba R}\end{equation}

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $R(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{c},\mathbf{v},\mathbf{y})=R(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{y},\mathbf{v},\mathbf{c})$
\end_inset

, we find
\begin_inset Formula \[
B_{(\mathbf{a})}(\mathbf{c},\mathbf{y})=B_{(\mathbf{a})}(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{c}).\]

\end_inset

In fact, the above relation holds for arbitrary vector fields 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 at any point, 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{(\mathbf{a})}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=B_{(\mathbf{a})}(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

, because it involves only the 
\emph on
value
\emph default
 of the connecting vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 at one point, and not the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 is a connecting vector.
 Hence, the bilinear form 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{(\mathbf{a})}$
\end_inset

 is symmetric, the vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 is integrable, and there exists a scalar function 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}=\hat{g}^{-1}\textrm{d}\phi$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To derive an equation for

\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{div}\mathbf{a}=\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})}g(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{a},\mathbf{y}).\]

\end_inset

It follows that
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{div}\mathbf{a}=-\textrm{div}\left(\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{v}\right)=\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})}R(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{v},\mathbf{y})=\textrm{Ric}(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v}).\]

\end_inset

On the other hand, 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}

\end_inset

In components, 
\begin_inset Formula $\square\phi=\nabla_{\mu}\nabla^{\mu}\phi$
\end_inset

 Hence, we obtain the following equation for 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$

\begin_inset Formula \[
\square\phi=\textrm{Ric}(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v}).\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To obtain a concrete expression for 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{Ric}(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})$
\end_inset

, we need to relate the curvature to the matter content of the spacetime.
 In the Newtonian approximation, the matter sources are approximately motionless
 particles, so the energy-momentum tensor of matter is 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\mu\nu}=\rho v_{\mu}v_{\nu}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho(x)$
\end_inset

 is the mass density.
 The Einstein equation,
\begin_inset Formula \[
R_{\mu\nu}-\frac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu}R_{\alpha}^{\alpha}=-8\pi T_{\mu\nu},\]

\end_inset

can be rewritten as
\begin_inset Formula \[
R_{\mu\nu}=-8\pi\left(T_{\mu\nu}-\frac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu}T_{\alpha}^{\alpha}\right).\]

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{\mu}v^{\mu}=1$
\end_inset

, we find 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\mu}^{\mu}=\rho$
\end_inset

 and finally
\begin_inset Formula \[
\square\phi=R_{\mu\nu}v^{\mu}v^{\nu}=-4\pi\rho.\]

\end_inset

This is in fact the familiar Poisson equation relating the Newtonian gravitation
al potential 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 to the density 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 of matter, written in a Lorentz-covariant way.
 In an almost-flat spacetime, we can choose the coordinate 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 along the orbits of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

, and then we have approximately
\begin_inset Formula \[
\square\phi=\left(\partial_{t}^{2}-\Delta\right)\phi=-4\pi\rho,\quad\Delta\equiv\partial_{x}^{2}+\partial_{y}^{2}+\partial_{z}^{2}.\]

\end_inset

The time derivatives are negligible since the distribution of matter is
 almost stationary (in the SI units, this is made more explicit by the factor
 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{c^{2}}\partial_{t}^{2}$
\end_inset

 We expect the Newtonian approximation to hold for large

 The vector

\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{t}$

\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})=1$

The vectors

 Let us compute the scalar products of

 with the basis vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v},\partial_{r},\partial_{\theta},\partial_{\phi}$

\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}

g(\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{v},\partial_{\theta}) & =-g(\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\partial_{\theta},\mathbf{v})=-g(\nabla_{\partial_{\theta}}\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})=0,\\
g(\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{v},\partial_{\phi}) & =0,\\
g(\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{v},\partial_{r}) & =-g(\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\partial_{r},\mathbf{v})=-g(\mathbf{v},[\mathbf{v},\partial_{r}])-g(\mathbf{v},\nabla_{\partial_{r}}\mathbf{v})\\
 & =-\frac{m}{r(r-2m)}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Therefore 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{v}=\frac{g(\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{v},\partial_{r})}{g(\partial_{r},\partial_{r})}\partial_{r}=\frac{m}{r^{2}}\partial_{r}.\]

The potential is easier to find from the 1-form

The fact that the Schwarzschild spacetime admits a

potential
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi(r)$
\end_inset

 is a consequence of spherical symmetry and time-independence, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
the metric
 depends only on the radius 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

.
 (More formally: The presence of an integrable Killing vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{t}$
\end_inset

 shows that the spacetime is static; additionally, the

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Killing vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{\theta}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{\phi}$

 indicate the spherical symmetry.) Thus the acceleration of an observer at
 constant 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is a vector directed along 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{r}$
\end_inset

 whose magnitude is a function only of 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore this acceleration must be equal to a gradient of some function
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi(r)$
\end_inset

 In general, all stationary spacetimes admit such a

The metric is given by Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(

\begin_inset Formula $x,y,z$
\end_inset

 The vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is simply equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{t}$
\end_inset

 and the basis of connecting vectors is 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{x},\partial_{y},\partial_{z}$
\end_inset

.
 Since the field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is integrable and normalized, it is geodesic and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{v}=0$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, stationary observers are at the same time freely falling and do
 not feel any gravity at all.
 However, the Newtonian approximation breaks down at sufficiently large
 distances.
 This can be seen by computing the relative acceleration of two nearby observers
 (see the following calculation),
\begin_inset Formula \[
\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\partial_{x}=H^{2}\partial_{x}.\]

\end_inset

At small distances

 not accelerated relative to each other.

Solution:

 We can compute

\begin_inset Formula \[

\end_inset

while scalar products of

 Thus we obtain Eq.\InsetSpace ~

A null geodesic with a null tangent vector

 From the Planck relation, 
\begin_inset Formula $E=h\nu$

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu=h^{-1}g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{u})$

 In a stationary spacetime, stationary observers have worldlines with 4-velocity
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{u}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{g(\mathbf{k},\mathbf{k})}}\mathbf{k}=z^{-1}\mathbf{k}.\]

\end_inset

Therefore, a stationary observer at a given location will measure the frequency
 of a given lightray with a (null) worldline 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)$

\begin_inset Formula \[
h\nu=g(z^{-1}\mathbf{k},\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}).\]

\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{k},\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}})$

According to our (so far) heuristic picture of an asymptotically flat spacetime
 as something generated by a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 clump of gravitating matter, we expect that at large distances the acceleration
 of stationary observers goes to zero, thus the gravitational potential
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi$
\end_inset

 becomes constant.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi=\ln z$
\end_inset

, this is equivalent to assuming that the redshift 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 becomes constant at infinite distances.
 Then it is convenient to multiply the Killing vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{k}$
\end_inset

 by a constant to achieve 
\begin_inset Formula $z\rightarrow1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi\rightarrow0$

Energy 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a stationary spacetime, the Killing vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{k}$
\end_inset

 generates time translations along the stationary worldlines.
 The local geometry of the spacetime is invariant under these time translations:
 for instance, the scalar product of connecting vectors remains constant.
 The existence of such time translations, in turn, leads to a conserved
 quantity, interpreted as the total energy of the spacetime.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We know that the distortion 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{(\mathbf{k})}$
\end_inset

 of a Killing vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{k}$
\end_inset

 is a 2-form, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
B_{(\mathbf{k})}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\equiv g(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{k},\mathbf{y})=-g(\nabla_{\mathbf{y}}\mathbf{k},\mathbf{x}).\]

\end_inset

In the index notation, we have
\begin_inset Formula \[
B_{(\mathbf{k})\alpha\beta}=\nabla_{\alpha}k_{\beta}.\]

\end_inset

 The divergence of this 2-form is a 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
e_{\beta}\equiv\nabla^{\alpha}B_{(\mathbf{k})\alpha\beta}=\nabla^{\alpha}\nabla_{\alpha}k_{\beta}\equiv\square k_{\beta};\quad\mathbf{e}=\square\mathbf{k}.\]

\end_inset

Written in the index-free notation, the expression for 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

 is significantly more cumbersome,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
e\circ\mathbf{z} & \equiv\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})}\left[\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}B_{(\mathbf{k})}\right]\circ(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z})\\
 & =\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})}\left[\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}g(\nabla_{\mathbf{y}}\mathbf{k},\mathbf{z})-g(\nabla_{\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y}},\mathbf{z})-g(\nabla_{\mathbf{y}}\mathbf{k},\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{z})\right].\end{align*}

\end_inset

So we shall use the index notation in the following calculations.
 The 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

 is divergence-free,
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Standard
The fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

 is divergence-free can be also understood as a consequence of the identity
 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{dd}*B_{(\mathbf{k})}=0$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $*$
\end_inset

 is the Hodge star 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{Hodge star}

\end_inset

operation.
 Thus the integral of the 3-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}*B_{(\mathbf{k})}$
\end_inset

 over a 3-volume can be expressed through an integral of 
\begin_inset Formula $*B_{(\mathbf{k})}$
\end_inset

 over a closed 2-surface.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\nabla^{\beta}e_{\beta}=\nabla^{\beta}\nabla^{\alpha}B_{(\mathbf{k})\alpha\beta}=0,\]

\end_inset

therefore it defines a conserved vector current 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}\equiv\hat{g}^{-1}e$
\end_inset

.
 The flux of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}$
\end_inset

 through a (spacelike) 3-volume 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 with a (timelike) normal vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is constant, up to boundary terms.
 Assuming that the 3-surface 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

extends to infinity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and that the current 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}$
\end_inset

 vanishes sufficiently quickly at infinity so that all the boundary terms
 vanish, we find that the quantity
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tilde{E}\equiv\int_{V}\left(e\circ\mathbf{v}\right)\textrm{d}^{3}V\equiv\int_{V}e_{\beta}v^{\beta}\textrm{d}^{3}V=\int_{V}\left(\square k_{\beta}\right)v^{\beta}\textrm{d}^{3}V\]

\end_inset

is independent of the choice of the 3-volume 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
 The quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{E}$
\end_inset

 is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

conserved charge
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that corresponds to the conserved current 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}$
\end_inset

.
 Alternatively, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{E}$
\end_inset

 can be written as an integral over a closed spacelike 2-surface 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 which is the boundary of 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\tilde{E}=\oint_{\Sigma}\left(\nabla_{\alpha}k_{\beta}\right)v^{\alpha}n^{\beta}\textrm{d}^{2}\Sigma,\label{eq:energy surface integral}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v},\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 are normal to the 2-surface 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 The 2-surface 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 lies outside of any matter sources and encircles the entire matter distribution.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We shall now express 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{E}$

 through the matter distribution using the Einstein equation.
 It is again more convenient to work in the index notation.
 We have seen in Statement\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{par:Exercise:nabla nabla Killing}

\end_inset

 that
\begin_inset Formula \[
\nabla_{\mu}\nabla_{\nu}k_{\alpha}=R_{\nu\alpha\mu}{}^{\beta}k_{\beta}.\]

\end_inset

Therefore
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
e_{\beta} & =\square k_{\beta}=g^{\alpha\gamma}R_{\alpha\beta\gamma}{}^{\delta}k_{\delta}=R_{\beta\delta}k^{\delta},\\
e\circ\mathbf{x} & =\textrm{Ric}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{k}),\\
\tilde{E} & =\int_{V}\textrm{Ric}(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{k})\textrm{d}^{3}V=\int_{V}R_{\mu\nu}v^{\mu}k^{\nu}\textrm{d}^{3}V.\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We shall now show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{E}$
\end_inset

 is proportional to the total energy 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 of the gravitating system in the Newtonian limit, where the gravitating
 matter is an isolated, stationary distribution of dust with density 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 The energy of such a system is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
E=\int_{V}\rho\textrm{d}^{3}V,\]

\end_inset

and the energy-momentum tensor is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
T_{\mu\nu}=\rho v_{\mu}v_{\nu},\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\approx\mathbf{k}$
\end_inset

 are the stationary worldlines of matter particles.
 By the Einstein equation\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Einstein}

\end_inset

), we have
\begin_inset Formula \[
R_{\mu\nu}=-8\pi(T_{\mu\nu}-\frac{1}{2}Tg_{\mu\nu}),\]

\end_inset

therefore
\begin_inset Formula \[
R_{\mu\nu}v^{\mu}k^{\nu}=-4\pi\rho v_{\mu}v_{\nu}v^{\mu}k^{\nu}\approx-4\pi\rho\]

\end_inset

and
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tilde{E}=\int_{V}R_{\mu\nu}v^{\mu}k^{\nu}\textrm{d}^{3}V\approx-4\pi\int_{V}\rho\textrm{d}^{3}V=-4\pi E.\]

 Thus the total energy of the system is, in the Newtonian approximation,
 
\begin_inset Formula \[

 Choosing the normal vectors

\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}

\end_inset

we find
\begin_inset Formula \[

Remark:

\begin_layout Standard
The total momentum and the total angular momentum of an isolated system
 are so far undefined.
 (There is no preferred reference frame with respect to which one would
 measure the total momentum or angular momentum.) A satisfactory definition
 of these quantities requires more information than the existence of a timelike
 Killing vector.
 For instance, symmetry with respect to rotations around an axis leads to
 conservation of the corresponding component of the angular momentum.
 In a curved spacetime, there are no preferred axes, so instead the rotational
 symmetry is formulated as the existence of a spacelike Killing vector with
 closed orbits (these orbits play the role of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_layout Section

 total energy of an isolated system can be defined through an integral over
 an infinitely remote 2-surface [see Eq.\InsetSpace ~

 It appears that such a definition only requires that a spacetime be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that is, almost stationary sufficiently far from the matter sources.
 In fact, it would be convenient if we could evaluate the 2-surface integral

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 where the spacetime is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 stationary (in a heuristic sense).
 The notion of conformal infinity allows one to make these ideas precise.
 We shall approach this notion by considering the elementary example of
 a flat Minkowski spacetime.

 A convenient way to produce such an

 Then the infinitely remote points can be located at finite distances according

 (Choosing more complicated functions for

It is obvious that the lines of constant

 the unphysical metric

As we described above, the unphysical manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$
\end_inset

 is constructed from the original spacetime manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 by changing the metric from 
\begin_inset Formula $g$

\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{g}$

\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{u}=\pm1$

\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{v}=\pm1$

 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$
\end_inset

 is a 
\emph on

\emph default

\emph default
.
 The boundary of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$
\end_inset

 consists of null lines (future null infinity and past null infinity), the
 spacelike infinity domain 
\begin_inset Formula $i^{0}$
\end_inset

, and timelike future infinity/past infinity points 
\begin_inset Formula $i^{\pm}$
\end_inset

.
 Note that the conformal factor 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{2\lambda}$
\end_inset

 vanishes on the boundary; this is what brings infinity to finite distances
 in the unphysical manifold.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To see that the choice of the function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(s)$
\end_inset

 is not entirely arbitrary, consider the spacelike infinity domain 
\begin_inset Formula $i^{0}$
\end_inset

 corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $r\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $u\rightarrow\infty,v\rightarrow-\infty$
\end_inset

).
 This domain is formally a 2-sphere of radius
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\tilde{r}^{2}(i^{0}) & =\lim_{r\rightarrow\infty}e^{\lambda}r^{2}=\lim_{{v\rightarrow-\infty\atop u\rightarrow\infty}}f^{\prime}(u)f^{\prime}(v)\frac{(u-v)^{2}}{4}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $f(s)\rightarrow\pm1$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $s\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

, the derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $f^{\prime}(s)$
\end_inset

 must go to zero at large 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

.
 Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $f^{\prime}(s)$
\end_inset

 tends to zero as 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim s^{-n}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $s\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

; then the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{r}^{2}(i^{0})$
\end_inset

 depends on the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $n\geq2$
\end_inset

 then the limit is zero, meaning that the domain of a ``spacelike infinity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a sphere of zero radius, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
a 
\emph on

\emph default
.
 In the opposite case, 
\begin_inset Formula $n<2$
\end_inset

, the limit is infinite, which means that the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{g}$
\end_inset

 diverges (is not regular) at the point 
\begin_inset Formula $i^{0}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus we are motivated to consider only the regular case 
\begin_inset Formula $n\geq2$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We may restrict the choice of the function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(s)$
\end_inset

 further.
 Let us consider the limit of the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{g}$
\end_inset

 along a fixed lightray, say 
\begin_inset Formula $u=u_{0}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $v\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

.
 The coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{r}^{2}$
\end_inset

 of the metric is then
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tilde{r}^{2}=\lim_{v\rightarrow\infty}f^{\prime}(u_{0})f^{\prime}(v)\frac{(u_{0}-v)^{2}}{4}.\]

\end_inset

This limit is equal to zero when 
\begin_inset Formula $n>2$
\end_inset

 but is finite and nonzero when 
\begin_inset Formula $n=2$
\end_inset

.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $f^{\prime}(s)\sim f_{0}s^{-2}$
\end_inset

, we find
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tilde{r}^{2}(\mathscr I^{+})=\frac{1}{4}f_{0}f^{\prime}(u_{0})>0.\]

\end_inset

 We expect that the structure of the null infinity should reflect the fact
 that null rays can be emitted in all directions spanning a 2-sphere.
 Thus, the null infinity at a fixed value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{u}=f(u_{0})$
\end_inset

 should have a metric structure of a 2-sphere with a nonzero radius.
 This is the case only if 
\begin_inset Formula $f^{\prime}(s)\propto s^{-2}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $s\rightarrow\pm\infty$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, we shall only consider these choices of 
\begin_inset Formula $f(s)$
\end_inset

.
 Then the future null infinity, denoted 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr I^{+}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

scri-plus
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

), has the topological structure 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}\times S^{2}$
\end_inset

 (a 2-sphere for each value 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{u}=\alpha$
\end_inset

), while a spacelike infinity is represented by a single point 
\begin_inset Formula $i^{0}$
\end_inset

.
 The asymptotic form of the unphysical metric near a point 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(u=u_{0},v=\infty\right)$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr I^{+}$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tilde{g}\approx d\tilde{u}\, d\tilde{v}-\frac{f_{0}f^{\prime}(u_{0})}{4}dS^{2},\]

\end_inset

while the conformal factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 near 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr I^{+}$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Omega\approx\frac{1}{f_{0}}\left(1-\tilde{u}\right)\left(1-\tilde{v}\right).\]

\end_inset

Therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega\sim r^{-1}$
\end_inset

 at large distances.
 From the above expression for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

, it is also easy to see that the null infinity 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr I^{+}$
\end_inset

 is a null surface: The normal vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}\equiv\hat{\tilde{g}}^{-1}\textrm{d}\Omega$
\end_inset

 is null on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr I^{+}$
\end_inset

 (but not away from it!) since
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tilde{g}(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{n})=\tilde{g}^{-1}(\textrm{d}\Omega,\textrm{d}\Omega)\propto\left(1-\tilde{u}\right)\left(1-\tilde{v}\right)\propto\Omega=0\;\textrm{ on }\mathscr I^{+}.\]

Solution:

 The Riemann tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $R(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c},\mathbf{d})$
\end_inset

 is a symmetric bilinear function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}\wedge\mathbf{d}$
\end_inset

; for a 2-dimensional vector space with a basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},\mathbf{e}_{2}\right\} $
\end_inset

, any exterior product 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\wedge\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 is proportional to the basis product 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}$
\end_inset

, so the space of exterior products 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\wedge\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 is one-dimensional.
 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $R(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c},\mathbf{d})$
\end_inset

 is effectively a symmetric bilinear function in one-dimensional space.
 Such a function is fully specified by one coefficient, say 
\begin_inset Formula $R(\mathbf{e}_{1},\mathbf{e}_{2},\mathbf{e}_{1},\mathbf{e}_{2})$
\end_inset

, or equivalently by the curvature scalar 
\begin_inset Formula $R=2R(\mathbf{e}_{1},\mathbf{e}_{2},\mathbf{e}_{1},\mathbf{e}_{2})$
\end_inset

.
 It is clear from the given relation that the curvature scalar can be made
 to vanish by a choice of the function 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

.
 Then the unphysical spacetime will have an identically vanishing Riemann
 tensor, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
it will be flat.

In the previous section we explored the construction of a conformal infinity
 for Minkowski spacetime.
 The result was an unphysical 4-dimensional manifold

 since it did not represent actual distances.
 However, this unphysical manifold allows one to evaluate quantities

at infinity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and hence is useful for the analysis of asymptotic behavior of fields in
 the real spacetime.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another important application of the unphysical manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$
\end_inset

 is as a tool to help visualize the causal structure of the physical spacetime
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

.
 Such a visualization is possible if one considers a 1+1-dimensional slice
 of the physical spacetime.
 This slice is a 1+1-dimensional spacetime 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}_{(1+1)}$
\end_inset

 having a certain 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

reduced
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 metric.
 This metric can be transformed into a flat Minkowski metric by a conformal
 transformation.
 Then, a coordinate transformation can be performed such that the manifold
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}_{(1+1)}$
\end_inset

 is mapped into into a 1+1-dimensional unphysical manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$
\end_inset

 having a finite extent in all directions.
 The resulting manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$
\end_inset

 can be simply drawn as a figure on a plane.
 (Implicitly, the plane carries the unphysical flat Minkowski metric; in
 particular, straight lines drawn at 
\begin_inset Formula $45^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 angles are null geodesics.) An example of such a drawing is Fig.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_layout Standard
A conformal diagram provides a visualization of the causal structure of
 a spacetime because the null geodesics remain straight lines after the
 conformal transformation, and because the entire spacetime is drawn as
 a finite figure in a plane.
 For instance, it is easy to see the entire domain that can receive signals
 from a given spacetime point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Remark:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is no analog of conformal diagrams for general 3+1-dimensional spacetimes.
 The reason is that a general spacetime is not conformally flat and cannot
 be mapped into a region of Minkowski spacetime by a conformal transformation.
 For instance, even if we demand that the spatial sections of the spacetime
 be flat and assume a metric of the form
\begin_inset Formula \[
g=\textrm{d}t\otimes\textrm{d}t-a^{2}(t,x_{1},x_{2},x_{3})\sum_{i=1}^{3}\textrm{d}x_{i}\otimes\textrm{d}x_{i},\]

\end_inset

the spacetime will be conformally flat only if 
\begin_inset Formula $a(t,x_{1},x_{2},x_{3})$
\end_inset

 has the special form
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula \[
a(t,x_{1},x_{2},x_{3})=\frac{1}{\eta(t)+\xi(t)\sum_{i=1}^{3}\left(x_{i}-\beta_{i}(t)\right)^{2}},\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{i},\eta,\xi$
\end_inset

 are arbitrary functions of time.
 Nevertheless, in many cases a 3+1-dimensional spacetime can be adequately
 represented by a suitable 1+1-dimensional slice, at least for the purpose
 of qualitative illustration.
 For instance, a spherically symmetric spacetime is visualized using the
 time-radial half-plane 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ t,r\right\} $
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $r\geq0$
\end_inset

, where each point stands for a 2-sphere of radius 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

.
 A conformal diagram is then drawn for the reduced 1+1-dimensional spacetime.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reduced conformal diagram is meaningful only if the null geodesics in
 the 1+1-dimensional section are also geodesics in the physical 3+1-dimensional
 spacetime.
 In this case, the 1+1-dimensional section can be visualized as the set
 of events accessible to an observer who sends and receives signals only
 along a fixed spatial direction.
 Then a conformal diagram provides information about the causal structure
 of spacetime along this line of sight.

\begin_layout Standard
After recapitulating the standard construction of conformal diagrams, I
 develop an easier method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Standard procedure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A conformal diagram is defined for a 1+1-dimensional spacetime with a given
 line element 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{ab}dx^{a}dx^{b}$
\end_inset

.
 The coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x^{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $a=0,1$
\end_inset

) must cover the 
\emph on
entire
\emph default
 spacetime, and several sets of overlapping coordinate patches may be used
 if necessary.
 The standard construction of the conformal diagram may be formulated as
 follows (see e.g.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{BirDav82}

\end_inset

, chapter\InsetSpace ~
3).
 One first finds a change of coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $x\rightarrow\tilde{x}$
\end_inset

 such that the new variables 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{x}^{a}$
\end_inset

 have a 
\emph on
finite
\emph default
 range of variation; the components of the metric change according to 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{ab}(x)dx^{a}dx^{b}=\tilde{g}_{ab}(\tilde{x})d\tilde{x}^{a}d\tilde{x}^{b}$
\end_inset

.
 One then chooses a conformal transformation of the metric (in the new coordinat
es), 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\tilde{g}_{ab}\rightarrow\gamma_{ab}\left(\tilde{x}\right)=\Omega^{2}\left(\tilde{x}\right)\tilde{g}_{ab},\quad\Omega\left(\tilde{x}\right)\neq0,\label{eq:g transf}\end{equation}

\end_inset

such that the new metric 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{ab}$
\end_inset

 is flat, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
has zero curvature.
 A suitable function 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega(\tilde{x})$
\end_inset

 always exists because all two-dimensional metrics are conformally flat.
 The new metric 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{ab}$
\end_inset

 describes an unphysical, auxiliary flat spacetime.
 Since the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{ab}$
\end_inset

 is flat, a further change of coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{x}\rightarrow\tilde{\tilde{x}}$
\end_inset

 (the new variables 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\tilde{x}}$
\end_inset

 again having a finite extent) can be found to transform 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{ab}$
\end_inset

 explicitly into the Minkowski metric 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{ab}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\gamma_{ab}\left(\tilde{x}\right)d\tilde{x}^{a}d\tilde{x}^{b}=\eta_{ab}d\tilde{\tilde{x}}^{a}d\tilde{\tilde{x}}^{b},\quad\eta_{ab}\equiv\textrm{diag}\left(1,-1\right).\label{eq:omega eta}\end{equation}

\end_inset

For brevity we incorporate all the required coordinate changes into one,
 
\begin_inset Formula $x\rightarrow\tilde{x}(x)$
\end_inset

, and summarize the transformation of the metric as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\Omega^{2}\left(x\right)g_{ab}dx^{a}dx^{b}=\eta_{ab}d\tilde{x}^{a}d\tilde{x}^{b}.\label{eq:g transf short}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Thus the new coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{x}^{a}$
\end_inset

 map the initial spacetime onto a 
\emph on
finite
\emph default
 domain within a 1+1-dimensional Minkowski plane.
 This finite domain is a 
\series bold
conformal diagram
\series default
 of the initial (physical) 1+1-dimensional spacetime.
 The diagram is drawn on a sheet of paper which implicitly carries the fiducial
 Minkowski metric 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{ab}$
\end_inset

, the vertical axis usually representing the timelike coordinate 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{x}^{0}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The coordinate and conformal transformations severely distort the geometry
 of the spacetime since they bring infinite spacetime points to finite distances
 in the diagram plane.
 So one cannot expect in general that straight lines in the diagram correspond
 to geodesics in the physical spacetime.
 However, it is well known that straight lines drawn at 
\begin_inset Formula $45^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 angles in a conformal diagram represent null geodesics in the physical
 spacetime.
 This follows from the fact that any null trajectory 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{a}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 in 1+1 dimensions, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
any solution of 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
g_{ab}\dot{x}^{a}\dot{x}^{b}=0,\quad\dot{x}^{a}\equiv\frac{dx^{a}}{d\tau},\label{eq:g x x}\end{equation}

\end_inset

is necessarily a geodesic (this is not true in higher dimensions), and Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:g x x}

\end_inset

) is invariant under conformal transformations of the metric.
 By drawing lightrays emitted from various points in the diagram, one can
 illustrate the causal structure of the spacetime.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A textbook example is the conformal diagram for the flat Minkowski spacetime
 with the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{ab}\equiv\eta_{ab}$
\end_inset

.
 Calculations are conveniently done in the lightcone coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
u\equiv x^{0}-x^{1},\; v\equiv x^{0}+x^{1},\;\eta_{ab}dx^{a}dx^{b}=du\, dv,\end{equation}

\end_inset

 and a suitable coordinate transformation is 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\tilde{u}=\tanh u,\;\tilde{v}=\tanh v,\; du\, dv=\frac{d\tilde{u}\, d\tilde{v}}{\left(1-\tilde{u}^{2}\right)\left(1-\tilde{v}^{2}\right)}.\label{eq:Mink lightcone}\end{equation}

\end_inset

The new coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{u},\tilde{v}$
\end_inset

 extend from 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

.
 Multiplying the metric by the conformal factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega^{2}(\tilde{u},\tilde{v})\equiv\left(1-\tilde{u}^{2}\right)\left(1-\tilde{v}^{2}\right)$
\end_inset

, we obtain the fiducial spacetime,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
 & \Omega^{2}du\, dv=d\tilde{u}\, d\tilde{v}=\eta_{ab}d\tilde{x}^{a}d\tilde{x}^{b},\\
 & \tilde{u}\equiv\tilde{x}^{0}-\tilde{x}^{1},\quad\tilde{v}\equiv\tilde{x}^{0}+\tilde{x}^{1}.\end{align}

\end_inset

The new coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{x}^{a}$
\end_inset

 have a finite extent, namely 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\tilde{x}^{0}\pm\tilde{x}^{1}\right|<1$
\end_inset

, and the resulting diagram has a diamond shape shown in Fig.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Minkowski}

\end_inset

.
 To appreciate the distortion of the spacetime geometry, we can draw the
 worldline of an inertial observer moving with a constant velocity.
 Note that the angle at which this trajectory enters the endpoints depends
 on the chosen conformal transformation and thus cannot serve as an indication
 of the observer's velocity.

\begin_layout Standard
There is no analog of conformal diagrams for general 3+1-dimensional spacetimes.
 Nevertheless, in many cases a 3+1-dimensional spacetime can be adequately
 represented by a suitable 1+1-dimensional slice, at least for the purpose
 of qualitative illustration.
 For instance, a spherically symmetric spacetime is visualized as the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(t,r\right)$
\end_inset

 half-plane (
\begin_inset Formula $r\geq0$
\end_inset

) where each point stands for a 2-sphere of radius 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

.
 A conformal diagram is then drawn for the reduced 1+1-dimensional spacetime.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The reduced conformal diagram is meaningful only if the null geodesics in
 the 1+1-dimensional section are also geodesics in the physical 3+1-dimensional
 spacetime.
 In this case, the 1+1-dimensional section can be visualized as the set
 of events accessible to an observer who sends and receives signals only
 along a fixed spatial direction.
 Then a conformal diagram provides information about the causal structure
 of spacetime along this line of sight.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Method of lightrays
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The standard construction of conformal diagrams involves an explicit transformat
ion of the metric to new coordinates that have a finite extent, and usually
 a further transformation to bring the metric to a manifestly conformally
 flat form.
 Finding these transformations requires a certain ingenuity.
 If the spacetime manifold is covered by several coordinate patches, a different
 transformation must be used in each patch.
 However, a conformal diagram typically consists of just a few lines and
 one would expect that the required computations should not be so cumbersome.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I now describe a method of drawing conformal diagrams that avoids the need
 for performing explicit transformations of the metric.
 The method is based on a qualitative analysis of intersections of lightrays.
 This approach is particularly suitable for the analysis of stochastic spacetime
s encountered in models of eternal inflation.
 Such spacetimes have no symmetries and their metric is not known in closed
 form, so one cannot apply the standard construction of conformal diagrams.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another motivation for the new method is the apparent redundancy involved
 in the standard method.
 It is clear that the transformations used in the standard construction
 are not unique.
 For instance, one may replace the lightcone coordinates in Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Mink lightcone}

\end_inset

) by
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\tilde{u}\rightarrow f\left(\tilde{u}\right),\quad\tilde{v}\rightarrow g\left(\tilde{v}\right),\label{eq:u v change}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $f,g$
\end_inset

 are arbitrary monotonic, bounded, and continuous functions.
 The shape of the diagram will vary with each possible choice of the transformat
ions, but all resulting diagrams are equivalent in the sense that they contain
 the same information about the causal structure of the spacetime.
 One thus expects to be able to extract this information without involving
 specific explicit transformations of the coordinates and the metric.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The crucial observation is that this information is unambiguously represented
 by the geometry and topology of lightrays and their intersections.
 I shall now develop this idea into a self-contained approach to drawing
 conformal diagrams that does not involve explicit transformations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
New definition of conformal diagrams
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A conformal diagram is a figure in the fiducial Minkowski plane satisfying
 certain conditions, and I first formulate a definition of a conformal diagram
 in terms of such conditions.
 A constructive procedure for drawing conformal diagrams will be presented
 subsequently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A finite open domain of the plane is a
\series bold

 of a given 1+1-dimensional spacetime 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 if there exists a one-to-one correspondence between all maximally extended
 lightrays in 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 and all straight line segments drawn at 
\begin_inset Formula $45^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 This correspondence must be 
\series bold
intersection-preserving
\series default
, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
any two lightrays intersect in the physical spacetime exactly as many
 times as the corresponding lines intersect in the diagram.
 It is assumed that all null geodesics in the spacetime 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 are either infinitely extendible or end at singularities or at explicitly
 introduced spacetime boundaries.
 Similarly, the straight line segments drawn at 
\begin_inset Formula $45^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 angles in a conformal diagram must be limited only by the boundary of the
 diagram.
 Note that there are only two spatial directions in a 1+1-dimensional spacetime
 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

, and that two lightrays emitted in the same direction cannot intersect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, the diamond 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\tilde{x}^{0}\pm\tilde{x}^{1}\right|<1$
\end_inset

 is a conformal diagram for the flat spacetime due to the intersection-preservin
g one-to-one correspondence of null lines 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{x}^{0}\pm\tilde{x}^{1}=\textrm{const}$
\end_inset

 in the diagram and lightrays 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{0}\pm x^{1}=\textrm{const}$
\end_inset

 in the physical spacetime.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For spacetimes having a nontrivial topology, appropriate topological features
 need to be introduced also into the fiducial Minkowski plane.
 At this point I do not consider such cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I shall now demonstrate the equivalence of the proposed definition to the
 standard procedure for drawing conformal diagrams.
 It suffices to find a conformal transformation of the form\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:g transf short}

\end_inset

) in some neighborhood of an arbitrary (nonsingular) spacetime point.
 Given a diagram with an intersection-preserving correspondence of lightrays,
 we can introduce local lightcone coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $u,v$
\end_inset

 in the diagram such that the null geodesics are locally the lines 
\begin_inset Formula $u=\textrm{const}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $v=\textrm{const}$
\end_inset

.
 By assumption, each null geodesic uniquely corresponds to a lightray in
 the physical spacetime.
 Since the correspondence is intersection-preserving, the local configuration
 of the null geodesics in the physical spacetime can be visualized as in
 Fig.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:correspondence}

\end_inset

.
 Hence the local lightcone coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $u,v$
\end_inset

 become well-defined local coordinates in the physical spacetime, and again
 the null geodesics are the lines 
\begin_inset Formula $u=\textrm{const}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $v=\textrm{const}$
\end_inset

.
 On the other hand, these null geodesics must be solutions of Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:g x x}

\end_inset

), therefore
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
g_{uu}\dot{u}^{2}+2g_{uv}\dot{u}\dot{v}+g_{vv}\dot{v}^{2}=0\,\textrm{ if }\,\dot{u}=0\textrm{ or }\dot{v}=0.\end{equation}

\end_inset

 It follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{uu}=g_{vv}=0$
\end_inset

.
 Thus the metric in the local lightcone coordinates is of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{ab}dx^{a}dx^{b}=2g_{uv}(u,v)du\, dv$
\end_inset

 which is explicitly conformally flat.
 This demonstrates the existence of a local conformal transformation bringing
 the physical metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{ab}$
\end_inset

 into the fiducial Minkowski metric 
\begin_inset Formula $du\, dv=\eta_{ab}d\tilde{x}^{a}d\tilde{x}^{b}$
\end_inset

 in the diagram.

\begin_layout Standard
Before presenting examples, I comment on the proposed definition of conformal
 diagrams.
 The definition may appear to be too broad, allowing many geometric shapes
 to represent the same spacetime.
 However, the old procedure also does not specify a particular conformal
 transformation of the metric and in effect admits precisely as much freedom.
 According to the new definition, any two different conformal diagrams of
 the same spacetime are equivalent in the sense that all the lightrays in
 those two diagrams will be in an intersection-preserving one-to-one corresponde
nce.
 In the old language, there must exist a conformal transformation bringing
 one diagram into the other.
 Equivalent diagrams carry identical information about the causal structure
 of the physical spacetime.
 In the next sections I shall give examples illustrating the arbitrary and
 the necessary choices involved in drawing conformal diagrams.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A conformal diagram delivers information mainly through the shape of its
 boundary line.
 The boundary of a conformal diagram generally contains points representing
 a spacelike, timelike, or null infinity, and points belonging to explicit
 boundaries of the spacetime manifold (e.g.\InsetSpace ~
singularities) where lightrays
 end in the physical spacetime.
 The latter boundaries will be called
\series bold
 physical boundaries
\series default
 to distinguish them from putative
\series bold
 infinite boundaries 
\series default
whose points do not correspond to any events in the physical spacetime.
 (The definition of conformal diagrams contains the requirement that the
 diagram domain be topologically open, and so the boundary points are not
 supposed to belong to the diagram.) The infinite boundary is of course the
 most interesting feature of a diagram.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lastly, I would like to emphasize that conformal diagrams can be drawn not
 only for geodesically complete spacetimes but also for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 spacetimes, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
for selected subdomains of larger manifolds.
 In fact such

\begin_layout Standard
The new definition merely lists the conditions to be satisfied by a conformal
 diagram.
 Based on these conditions, I now develop a practical procedure for drawing
 the diagrams, using the Minkowski spacetime as the first example.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We begin by choosing a Cauchy surface in the physical spacetime.
 In 1+1 dimensions, a Cauchy surface is a line 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 such that intersections of lightrays emitted from 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 entirely cover the part of the spacetime to the future of 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

.
 In the Minkowski spacetime, we may choose the line 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{0}=0$
\end_inset

 as the Cauchy surface 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

.
 The image of the Cauchy surface 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 in the conformal diagram must be a finite curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{L}$
\end_inset

 from which lightrays can be emitted in both spatial directions.
 Therefore the slope of the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{L}$
\end_inset

 must not exceed 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm45^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 but otherwise 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{L}$
\end_inset

 may be drawn arbitrarily, e.g.\InsetSpace ~
as the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $AB$
\end_inset

 in Fig.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:build Mink}

\end_inset

.
 The endpoints 
\begin_inset Formula $A,B$
\end_inset

 represent a spatial infinity in the two directions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the Minkowski spacetime, two lightrays emitted towards each other from
 any two points on 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 will eventually intersect.
 Therefore the domain of the conformal diagram must contain at least the
 triangular region 
\begin_inset Formula $ABC$
\end_inset

.
 On the other hand, any point outside 
\begin_inset Formula $ABC$
\end_inset

, such as the point 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 in Fig.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:build Mink}

\end_inset

, cannot belong to the diagram domain because the point 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 cannot be reached by any left-directed lightray emitted from 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

, and we know that all points in the Minkowski spacetime are intersection
 points of some lightrays.
 (More formally, the existence of the point 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 within the diagram would violate the condition that the correspondence
 between lightrays is intersection-preserving.) Therefore the future-directed
 part of the conformal diagram is bounded by the lines 
\begin_inset Formula $AC$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $BC$

A completely analogous consideration involving past-directed lightrays leads

We can also ascertain that the points

\begin_inset Formula $BC$

 remote points of 
\begin_inset Formula $L$

 At sufficiently late times, any inertial observer in the Minkowski spacetime
 will catch lightrays emitted from arbitrarily far points.
 The same holds for observers moving non-inertially as long as their velocity
 does not approach that of light.
 Hence all trajectories of such observers must finish at

It is clear that in any 1+1-dimensional spacetime a sufficiently small neighborh

\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}

 The Cauchy line

 In the coordinate system\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset Formula $dx/dt=\pm e^{-Ht}$

\begin_inset Formula $t=0$

 only reaches the values 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|x\right|<H^{-1}$

 Null geodesics emitted from the Cauchy surface and from the boundary lines

 A lightray emitted in the positive direction, such as the ray

 Considering a ray

 The intersection of

 along a common timelike boundary.

\begin_layout Subsection
How to draw conformal diagrams
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:General-procedure}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can now outline a general procedure for building a conformal diagram
 for a given 1+1-dimensional spacetime using the method of lightrays.
 The procedure can be applied not only to geodesically complete spacetimes
 but also to spacetimes with explicitly specified boundaries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One starts by considering the future-directed part of the spacetime and
 by choosing a suitable Cauchy surface and, possibly, some timelike boundaries.
 These lines are represented in the diagram by arbitrarily drawn horizontal
 and vertical curves of finite extent.
 The endpoints of these curves correspond either to the intersection points
 of Cauchy lines and timelike boundaries, or to imaginary points at spacelike
 and timelike infinity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that Cauchy surfaces and timelike boundaries are the lines on which
 boundary conditions for e.g.\InsetSpace ~
a wave equation must be specified to obtain a
 unique solution within a domain.
 One expects that any physically relevant spacetime should contain a suitable
 set of Cauchy surfaces and timelike boundaries, if the classical field
 theory is to have predictive power.
 Qualitative knowledge of the geometry and topology of these boundaries
 is required for building a conformal diagram using the method of lightrays.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After drawing the curves for the physical boundaries, it remains to determine
 the shape of the infinite (timelike and null) boundaries of the diagram.
 To this end, one can first consider 
\emph on
right-directed
\emph default
 lightrays emitted from various points on the Cauchy line and from the boundarie
s, including the limit points at infinity.
 For each right-directed lightray 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 there exists a certain subset 
\begin_inset Formula ${\cal S}_{X}$
\end_inset

 of (left-directed) lightrays that intersect 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

.
 Since the subset 
\begin_inset Formula ${\cal S}_{X}$
\end_inset

 has a finite extent, there exists a rightmost ray 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{X}\in{\cal S}_{X}$
\end_inset

.
 (In the de Sitter example above, the rightmost ray 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{A}$
\end_inset

 is the ray 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 and the rightmost ray 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{D}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

.) By definition of the conformal diagram, the lightrays are straight lines
 limited only by the boundary of the conformal diagram, therefore the intersecti
on point of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{X}$
\end_inset

 must belong to the boundary.
 In this way we have established the location of one point of the unknown
 boundary line, namely the endpoint of the ray 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To determine the local direction of the boundary line at that point, we
 use the following argument.
 For each right-directed lightray 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

, we can consider a right-directed ray 
\begin_inset Formula $X'$
\end_inset

 infinitesimally close and to the right of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 (if no ray 
\begin_inset Formula $X'$
\end_inset

 can be found to the right of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

, it means that 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 itself belongs to the boundary of the diagram).
 Then there are two possibilities (see Fig.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:general procedure}

\end_inset

a,b): either the rightmost ray 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{X}$
\end_inset

 is also the rightmost ray 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{X'}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $X'$
\end_inset

, or the ray 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{X'}$
\end_inset

 is located to the right of 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{X}$
\end_inset

.
 In the first case, the boundary line has a 
\begin_inset Formula $45^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 slope and locally coincides with 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{X}$
\end_inset

, while in the second case the boundary line is horizontally-directed.
 Thus we can draw a right-directed fragment of the infinite boundary that
 limits the ray 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

.
 We then continue by moving further to the right and consider the endpoint
 of the ray 
\begin_inset Formula $X'$
\end_inset

, etc.

\begin_layout Standard
The same procedure is then repeated for left-directed lightrays, until one
 finishes drawing all unknown lines in the future-directed part of the diagram.
 In this way the infinite boundary of the conformal diagram is constructed
 as the locus of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

last intersections
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of lightrays.
 Finally one applies the same considerations to past-directed lightrays
 and so completes the diagram.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It follows that the infinite boundary of a conformal diagram can always
 be drawn as a sequence of either straight line segments directed at 
\begin_inset Formula $45^{\circ}$
\end_inset

 angles, or horizontally- and vertically-directed curves.
 In our convention, Cauchy surfaces and artificial timelike boundaries are
 drawn as curved lines and infinite boundaries as straight lines (when possible).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us briefly consider the pasting of conformal diagrams in general.
 When two spacetime domains are separated by a timelike worldline, the correspon
ding conformal diagrams can be pasted together along the boundary line.
 To verify this almost obvious statement more formally, we begin by drawing
 the timelike boundary as a vertically-directed line in the diagram.
 The shape of the conformal diagram to the right of the boundary is determined
 solely by the intersections of lightrays within the right half of the spacetime.
 Hence, the conformal diagram for the right half of the spacetime can be
 pasted to the right of the timelike boundary line.
 The same holds for the left half of the spacetime.
 This justifies pasting of diagrams along a common timelike boundary.

Collapsing star
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The method of lightrays does not require explicit formulae for the spacetime
 metric if the qualitative behavior of lightrays is known.
 As another example of using the lightray method, let us consider an asymptotica
lly flat spacetime with a star collapsing to a black hole (BH).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To reduce the spacetime to 1+1 dimensions, we assume spherical symmetry
 and consider only the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(r,t\right)$
\end_inset

 plane, where 
\begin_inset Formula $0<r<+\infty$
\end_inset

 and the line 
\begin_inset Formula $r=0$
\end_inset

, the center of the star, is an artificial boundary.
 As before, we start with the future-directed part of the diagram.
 We must first choose a Cauchy surface; a suitable Cauchy surface is the
 line 
\begin_inset Formula $t=t_{0}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{0}$
\end_inset

 is a time chosen before the collapse of the star.
 We represent the Cauchy surface by the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $AB$
\end_inset

 in the diagram (Fig.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:build star}

\end_inset

).
 The point 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 corresponds to (
\begin_inset Formula $r=0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $t=t_{0}$
\end_inset

), while 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 is a spatial infinity 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(r=\infty,t=t_{0}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The artificial boundary 
\begin_inset Formula $r=0$
\end_inset

 is represented by the vertical line 
\begin_inset Formula $AC$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To investigate the shape of the future part of the diagram, we need to analyze
 the intersections of lightrays emitted from faraway points of the Cauchy
 surface.
 We know from qualitative considerations of the black hole formation that
 lightrays can escape from the star interior only until the appearance of
 the BH horizon.
 Shortly thereafter the star center becomes a singularity that cannot emit
 any lightrays.
 Hence, among all the rays emitted from the star center at various times,
 there exists a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

last ray
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 not captured by the BH, while rays emitted later are captured.
 We arbitrarily choose a point 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 on the boundary line 
\begin_inset Formula $r=0$
\end_inset

 to represent the emission of this 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

last ray.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Any lightray emitted from 
\begin_inset Formula $r=0$
\end_inset

 before 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 will propagate away from the BH and so will intersect all left-directed
 lightrays emitted from arbitrarily remote points of the Cauchy line 
\begin_inset Formula $AB$
\end_inset

.
 Since all the intersection points are outside of the BH horizon, it follows
 that the conformal diagram contains the polygon 
\begin_inset Formula $AEFB$
\end_inset

 which represents the spacetime outside the BH.
 The line 
\begin_inset Formula $FB$
\end_inset

 is the infinite null boundary of the diagram, while the line 
\begin_inset Formula $EF$
\end_inset

 is the BH horizon.

\begin_layout Standard
It is clear that the point 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 is the last point from which lightrays can be emitted from the star center
 and thus 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 is the beginning of the BH singularity.
 It remains to determine the shape of the diagram between the points 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

.
 We know that a lightray emitted from the center after 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 will be recaptured by the BH singularity and thus will not intersect with
 lightrays entering the BH horizon sufficiently late.
 For instance, the lightray emitted at 
\begin_inset Formula $E'$
\end_inset

 will intersect with the lightray 
\begin_inset Formula $F'$
\end_inset

 but not with a later ray 
\begin_inset Formula $F''$
\end_inset

, as shown in Fig.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:build star}

\end_inset

.
 Therefore the diagram boundary line connecting 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 is locally horizontally-directed.
 This line consists of final intersection points of lightrays emitted from
 the star center and those entering the BH horizon from outside.
 These final intersection points are located at the BH singularity which
 is therefore represented by the entire line 
\begin_inset Formula $CF$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The past-directed part of the conformal diagram is easy to construct.
 Since any two past-directed lightrays intersect, the past-directed part
 is similar to that for the Minkowski spacetime with a boundary at 
\begin_inset Formula $r=0$
\end_inset

, namely the triangular domain 
\begin_inset Formula $ABD$
\end_inset

 Thus the diagram in Fig.\InsetSpace ~

 is complete.

 We shall now construct the diagram for the future part of a de Sitter spacetime
 with spatially unlimited sections.
 (Note that the past half of the de Sitter spacetime is not covered by the
 flat coordinates because of incompleteness of past-directed geodesics.
 In this paper we shall not use the complete de Sitter spacetime but only
 the future of an arbitrarily chosen, unbounded, spacelike Cauchy hypersurface.)

\begin_inset Formula $t=t_{0}$

 line 
\begin_inset Formula $AB$

 in Fig.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:de Sitter3}

\end_inset

).
 The points 
\begin_inset Formula $A,B$
\end_inset

 in the diagram represent a spacelike infinity in the two directions and
 do not correspond to any points in the physical spacetime.
 It remains to establish the shape of the infinite future boundary which
 must be a line connecting the points 
\begin_inset Formula $A,B$
\end_inset

 to the future of the Cauchy surface.
 We already know from the construction of the diagram in Fig.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:de Sitter 1}

\end_inset

 that this future boundary is locally horizontal.
 Since the behavior of lightrays emitted from all points of the Cauchy surface
 is the same, the future boundary may be represented by a horizontal straight
 line connecting the points 
\begin_inset Formula $A,B$
\end_inset

.
 (To keep the convention of having straight infinite boundaries, we have
 drawn the Cauchy surface 
\begin_inset Formula $t=t_{0}$

 as a curve extending downward from the straight line

 Let

 First, we note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{g}(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{n})=0$

 Secondly, there is a freedom to rescale the unphysical metric by a nowhere

 Under such a rescaling, the function

f\rightarrow e^{-\lambda}\left(f+2\tilde{\nabla}_{\mathbf{n}}\lambda\right)\:\textrm{ on }\mathscr I^{+}.\label{eq:f change eq}\end{equation}

 A replacement

 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{g}(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{n})=\tilde{g}^{-1}(\textrm{d}\Omega,\textrm{d}\Omega)$
\end_inset

 and the differential 
\begin_inset Formula $d$

 transforms under the above replacements as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
f & =\Omega^{-1}\tilde{g}^{-1}(\textrm{d}\Omega,\textrm{d}\Omega)\\

 By assumption,

 Since the vector field

\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$

 Finally, the complex-valued vector

 The normalization

 Thus, the physical null tetrad

The convenience of the null tetrads is in the concise way they describe
 components of tensors.
 For example, the antisymmetric Maxwell tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $F(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})$

\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\Phi_{0} & \equiv F(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{m}),\\
\Phi_{1} & \equiv\frac{1}{2}F(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{l})-\frac{1}{2}F(\mathbf{m},\bar{\mathbf{m}}),\\
\Phi_{2} & \equiv F(\bar{\mathbf{m}},\mathbf{l}).\end{align*}

\end_inset

(The properties of the tetrad components 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{j}$
\end_inset

 are studied in the Statement below.) The unphysical components 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\Phi}_{j}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $j=0,1,2$
\end_inset

, are given by the same equations with the unphysical tetrad.
 The relation between the physical and the unphysical components is therefore
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Phi_{0}=\Omega\tilde{\Phi}_{0},\quad\Phi_{1}=\Omega^{2}\tilde{\Phi}_{1},\quad\Phi_{2}=\Omega^{3}\tilde{\Phi}_{2}.\]

\end_inset

Since the Maxwell field is conformally invariant, the unphysical components
 will also satisfy the Maxwell equations and will have regular solutions
 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr I^{+}$
\end_inset

.
 It is now easy to see that the component 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{0}$
\end_inset

 will be the slowest-decaying one, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Phi_{0}\sim\Omega\sim\frac{1}{r},\]

\end_inset

while other components will decay faster.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{j}$
\end_inset

 represent the field strength, which should decay as 
\begin_inset Formula $r^{-1}$
\end_inset

 for a radiation field.
 Hence, it is clear that the the intensity of

outgoing radiation
\emph default
 (i.e.\InsetSpace ~
energy carried away to infinity) must be independent of the two other
 components 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi_{1,2}$
\end_inset

 In fact, the radiated power is proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\Phi_{0}\right|^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Since the unphysical component 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\Phi}_{0}$
\end_inset

 is constant at infinity, the differential intensity of radiation in a given
 (null) direction can be obtained directly by evaluating 
\begin_inset Formula $|\tilde{\Phi}_{0}|^{2}$
\end_inset

 at a point of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr I^{+}$

\end_inset

note that this component of the Weyl tensor coincides with that of the Riemann
 tensor.
 The component 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{0}$

 decays as 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim\Omega=r^{-1}$

 to

 Under this transformation, the tetrad components

\begin_layout Subsection
Singularities and geodesic incompleteness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is well known that some spacetimes occurring in general relativity contain
 points where the force of gravity becomes 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

infinitely large
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (more precisely, the geometric description of the spacetime breaks down).
 Such spacetimes are called 
\series bold
singular
\series default
.
 Two major examples of singular spacetimes are the Schwarzschild spacetime
 and a generic Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) spacetime.
 In the Schwarzschild spacetime, it is relatively easy to understand that
 the black hole center 
\begin_inset Formula $r=0$
\end_inset

 represents a singularity because the curvature becomes infinite as 
\begin_inset Formula $r\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

, indicating the presence of unboundedly large tidal forces.
 Also, every timelike or null geodesic entering the Schwarzschild radius
 cannot escape hitting the center within a finite time.
 No lightrays or timelike geodesics can be continued past that point because
 the geometry is singular and the geodesic equation becomes undefined (i.e.\InsetSpace ~
it
 does not predict how a body will move past the center).
 Since the tidal forces will tear apart any material objects approaching
 the center, it is reasonable to conclude that there is no sensible way
 to describe the evolution of an observer past the center of a black hole.
 Thus the center is a place where the geometry of the spacetime cannot be
 described by general relativity.
 In an FRW spacetime with the scale factor 
\begin_inset Formula $a(t)\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $t\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

, the curvature is unbounded near 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly to the Schwarzschild case, geodesics cannot be extended to the
 past beyond 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0$
\end_inset

, so one cannot describe what happened to an observer before 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0$
\end_inset

.
 In this sense, 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0$
\end_inset

 is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

beginning of time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for an FRW spacetime.
 It is reasonable to say that the 3-surface 
\begin_inset Formula $t=0$
\end_inset

 in an FRW spacetime is singular.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the spacetime manifold is not smooth at 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

singular
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 points, it is natural to excise such points from the spacetime and to restrict
 the calculations to regular (nonsingular) points.

\begin_layout Standard
It is conjectured that a quantum theory of gravity (to be developed) will
 replace 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

singularities
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 by some well-defined and finite new physics.
 At this point, it is safe to say that the classical theory of general relativit
y breaks down at singularities.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Hence, one finds a curious situation: gravitational singularities are not

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 and are not present 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

anywhere
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Since all the singular points are removed, it is difficult to formulate
 a general definition of a singularity in terms of internal properties of
 the remaining nonsingular manifold.
 Nevertheless, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

presence
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of singularities is usually manifested in several ways.
 For instance, the curvature may become infinite along a certain geodesic
 worldline, indicating that a freely falling observer following that worldline
 will experience unbounded tidal forces.
 Or, certain geodesics may have only a finite range of the affine parameter,
 because these geodesics 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hit a singularity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and cannot be extended any further.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An accepted way to define a singular spacetime is through the non-extensibility
 of geodesics.
 Intuitively, a geodesic should be able to extend 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 in the way.

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

singular
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 in some way.
 Usually, only timelike and null geodesics are used to determine geodesic
 completeness.
 (Note that a spacetime can be intuitively 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

singular
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 without containing any incomplete timelike and null geodesics because the
 singularity may be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

infinitely far away,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 approachable after finite proper time only by a sufficiently highly accelerated
 observer, or by a spacelike geodesic.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Solution:
\emph default
 By the Killing property, 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{k},\mathbf{v})=0$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}g(\mathbf{k},\mathbf{v})=g(\mathbf{k},\mathbf{a})$
\end_inset

 It remains to show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|g(\mathbf{k},\mathbf{a})\right|<\left|g(\mathbf{k},\mathbf{v})\mathbf{a}\right|$
\end_inset

 for timelike 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{k},\mathbf{v}$

 and spacelike 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\neq0$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{a})=0$
\end_inset

.
 We may decompose 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{k}=\alpha\mathbf{a}+\beta\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{s}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\alpha\equiv\frac{g(\mathbf{k},\mathbf{a})}{g(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{a})},\quad\beta\equiv g(\mathbf{k},\mathbf{v}),\]

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}$
\end_inset

 is a spacelike vector orthogonal to both 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
 Then the inequality 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{k},\mathbf{k})>0$
\end_inset

 yields
\begin_inset Formula \[
g(\mathbf{k},\mathbf{k})=\beta^{2}-\alpha^{2}\left|\mathbf{a}\right|^{2}-\left|\mathbf{s}\right|^{2}>0,\]

\end_inset

hence 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left|\beta\right|=\left|g(\mathbf{k},\mathbf{v})\right|>\left|\alpha\right|\left|\mathbf{a}\right|=\frac{1}{\left|\mathbf{a}\right|}\left|g(\mathbf{k},\mathbf{a})\right|,\]

\end_inset

 which is equivalent to the desired inequality.
 Rewriting it as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left|\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\ln g(\mathbf{k},\mathbf{v})\right|<\left|\mathbf{a}\right|,\]

\end_inset

and integrating both sides, we have
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\left|\int_{\tau_{0}}^{\infty}\textrm{d}\tau\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\ln g(\mathbf{k},\mathbf{v})\right| & \leq\int_{\tau_{0}}^{\infty}\textrm{d}\tau\left|\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\ln g(\mathbf{k},\mathbf{v})\right|\\
 & \leq\int\left|\mathbf{a}\right|\textrm{d}\tau<\infty.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Therefore the total change of 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln g(\mathbf{k},\mathbf{v})$
\end_inset

 is bounded.
 Since for any timelike vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 we have the inequality
\begin_inset Formula \[
g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x})g(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{y})\leq\left[g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\right]^{2},\]

\end_inset

it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{k},\mathbf{k})\leq\left|g(\mathbf{k},\mathbf{v})\right|$
\end_inset

 and thus the total change of 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{k},\mathbf{k})$
\end_inset

 along the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)$
\end_inset

 is bounded for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$

 A full discussion of possible varieties of cosmological inflation is beyond

 Locally, the parameters

 The main statement is that such an inflationary spacetime cannot be also
 eternal to the past.
 The way to prove this is to show that a past-directed timelike geodesic

 Events that preceded that time are not described by the inflationary spacetime

 The Hubble law, 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{c}_{j}=H\mathbf{c}_{j}$

\begin_inset Formula \[
g(\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{c}_{j},\mathbf{c}_{j})=\frac{1}{2}\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}g(\mathbf{c}_{j},\mathbf{c}_{j})=-\frac{1}{2}\partial_{t}a^{2}=-a^{2}H.\]

\end_inset

Then we compute the divergence using the decomposition
\begin_inset Formula \[
g^{-1}=\mathbf{v}\otimes\mathbf{v}-a^{-2}\sum_{j=1}^{3}\mathbf{c}_{j}\otimes\mathbf{c}_{j}\]

\end_inset

that follows from the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v},a^{-1}\mathbf{c}_{1},a^{-1}\mathbf{c}_{2},a^{-1}\mathbf{c}_{3}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is an orthonormal basis.
 Hence,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\textrm{div }\mathbf{v} & =\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})}g(\mathbf{x},\nabla_{\mathbf{y}}\mathbf{v})\\
 & =g(\mathbf{v},\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{v})-a^{-2}\sum_{j=1}^{3}g(\mathbf{c}_{j},\nabla_{\mathbf{c}_{j}}\mathbf{v})\\

Given an everywhere diverging geodesic congruence, we define the local Hubble
 expansion rate to be 
\begin_inset Formula $H\equiv\frac{1}{3}\textrm{div}\mathbf{v}$

\begin_inset Formula $H_{0}>0$

Now we imagine that some dust-like particles follow the geodesic congruence
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 everywhere, and consider a geodesic observer who moves through the universe
 and measures the velocities of the dust particles.
 This observer can conclude that the spacetime is inflating and measure
 the local value of 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 in the following way.
 Let the observer's worldline be 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)$
\end_inset

 with an affine tangent vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}\equiv\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}$
\end_inset

, such that 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{u})=1$
\end_inset

.
 In principle, the observer can measure the following two (3-dimensional)
 quantities: the relative velocity, 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}_{\textrm{rel}}(\tau)$
\end_inset

, of the particle that passes by the observer at a time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

, and the displacement vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\vec{x}(\tau;\tau')$
\end_inset

, in the observer's rest frame, between nearby particles that passed the
 observer at times 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau'$
\end_inset

.
 After registering two nearby particles at times 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau'\equiv\tau+\delta\tau$
\end_inset

, the observer can calculate the separation and the relative velocity of
 the two particles in the (approximate) local rest frame of the particles.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 be a normalized, spacelike vector describing the separation between two
 particles in the particle rest frame.
 Then the observer can compute the quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{n},\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}\mathbf{v})$
\end_inset

 and thus estimate the local Hubble rate from the rate of change of the
 separation in the direction 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
H\equiv\frac{1}{3}\textrm{div}\mathbf{v}\approx-g(\mathbf{n},\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}\mathbf{v})\]

\end_inset

(the minus sign compensates for the spacelike character of the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}\mathbf{v}$

).
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 must be normalized, 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{n})=-1$
\end_inset

, so the observed Hubble rate depends only on the direction of the observer's
 motion but not on its speed.
 Since the spacetime is approximately isotropic, the estimate of the value
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 from a single direction 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 is expected to be reasonably accurate.

Solution:

 The vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}dt$
\end_inset

 should represent the infinitesimal displacement of the observer in the
 particle rest frame, where the time interval is 
\begin_inset Formula $dt$
\end_inset

.
 Spatial vectors in the particle rest frame are (spacelike) vectors orthogonal
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 is proportional to the projection of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 onto the subspace 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}^{\perp}$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{n}=\frac{\mathbf{u}-\mathbf{v}g(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})}{\left|\mathbf{u}-\mathbf{v}g(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})\right|}=\frac{\mathbf{u}-\alpha\mathbf{v}}{\sqrt{\alpha^{2}-1}},\]

\end_inset

where we have used 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{u})=g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})=1$
\end_inset

.
 Now we can directly compute 
\begin_inset Formula $H\equiv-g(\mathbf{n},\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}\mathbf{v})$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is normalized and geodesic, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{v},\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{v})=0=g(\mathbf{x},\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{v})$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

.
 So the only surviving term in 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{n},\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}\mathbf{v})$
\end_inset

 is proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{u},\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{v})$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
H=-g(\mathbf{n},\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}\mathbf{u})=-\frac{g(\mathbf{u},\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{v})}{\alpha^{2}-1}=-\frac{\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\alpha}{\alpha^{2}-1}.\]

\end_inset

This is the desired formula.
 In the instantaneous inertial frame where the observer is at rest, we have
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}=\left\{ 1,0,0,0\right\} $
\end_inset

 and thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}=\left\{ \alpha,\alpha\vec{v}_{\textrm{rel}}\right\} $
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\alpha(\tau)\equiv\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\vec{v}_{\textrm{rel}}^{2}(\tau)}}\]

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 is the observer's proper time.
 In this way, the observer can compute 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha(\tau)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\alpha\equiv\partial_{\tau}\alpha$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Replacing 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{\tau}$
\end_inset

, we can simplify the formula for 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 to
\begin_inset Formula \[
H(\tau)=\frac{1}{2}\partial_{\tau}\ln\frac{\alpha(\tau)+1}{\alpha(\tau)-1}.\]

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha>1$
\end_inset

, we have
\begin_inset Formula \[
\ln\frac{\alpha(\tau)+1}{\alpha(\tau)-1}>0\quad\textrm{for all }\tau.\]

\end_inset

 Finally, our hypothetical observer can integrate the instantaneous value
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $H(\tau)$
\end_inset

 along the worldline 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)$
\end_inset

.
 By assumption, 
\begin_inset Formula $H\geq H_{0}$
\end_inset

, therefore
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}H(\tau)\textrm{d}\tau\geq H_{0}(\tau_{2}-\tau_{1})\]

\end_inset

for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{1},\tau_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 On the other hand, 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}H(\tau)\textrm{d}\tau & =\frac{1}{2}\ln\frac{\alpha(\tau_{2})+1}{\alpha(\tau_{2})-1}-\frac{1}{2}\ln\frac{\alpha(\tau_{1})+1}{\alpha(\tau_{1})-1}\\
 & <\frac{1}{2}\ln\frac{\alpha(\tau_{2})+1}{\alpha(\tau_{2})-1}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Hence, there is a lower bound on the admissible values 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{1}$
\end_inset

 of the proper time,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tau_{1}>\tau_{2}-\frac{1}{2H_{0}}\ln\frac{\alpha(\tau_{2})+1}{\alpha(\tau_{2})-1}\equiv\tau_{\min}(\tau_{2}).\]

\end_inset

This means that no timelike geodesic can be extended to the past further
 than to 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{\min}(\tau_{2})$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, the spacetime is geodesically incomplete to the past.
 (A similar argument shows that null geodesics are also past-incomplete.)
 The only geodesic worldlines that might be complete to the past are the
 particle worldlines.

\begin_layout Standard
What could the observer see at earlier times 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau\leq\tau_{\min}$

 The only alternative to the presence of singularities is to conclude that

It is intuitively obvious that the divergence of the field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 tends to infinity at a focal point.
 To show this more formally, consider the defining property of the divergence
 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{div}\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{u}}V=\partial_{\tau}V=(\textrm{div}\mathbf{u})V,\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 is a 3-volume spanned by three connecting vectors transverse to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

.
 As we cross a focal point, at least one of the connecting vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 that span 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 will vanish.
 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 passes through 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 at a focal point; in the generic case where the function 
\begin_inset Formula $V(\tau)$
\end_inset

 has only simple zeros, 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 will also change sign after a focal point.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{\tau}V\equiv\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}V$
\end_inset

 is always finite since 
\begin_inset Formula $V=\varepsilon(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{c}_{1},\mathbf{c}_{2},\mathbf{c}_{3})$
\end_inset

 and every connecting vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}_{j}$
\end_inset

 satisfies a linear equation and thus cannot become infinite.
 Therefore, any point where 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{div}\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 becomes infinite must be a focal point where 
\begin_inset Formula $V=0$
\end_inset

.
 Also, we can rewrite the above equation as 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{div}\mathbf{u}=\partial_{\tau}\ln V$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{div}\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 remains finite, 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln V$
\end_inset

 cannot go to 
\begin_inset Formula $-\infty$
\end_inset

 within a finite time 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
 It follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{div}\mathbf{u}\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

 at a focal point.
 (In the generic case, we will have 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{div}\mathbf{u}\rightarrow-\infty$
\end_inset

 before a focal point and 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{div}\mathbf{u}\rightarrow+\infty$
\end_inset

 after a focal point.) Thus we have proved that the condition 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{div}\mathbf{u}\rightarrow\infty$

 is necessary and sufficient for the existence of a focal point of a field

Finally, let us develop a qualitative picture of why conjugate points occur.
 We have seen that gravity generally acts as an attractive force that makes
 geodesics converge.
 Therefore, a bunch of geodesics emitted from a point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 will usually tend to refocus at a later point 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

.
 The refocusing may take a while, but once the divergence 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{div}\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 becomes negative along one line, refocusing is inevitable within a finite
 time.
 (Note that the focusing theorem applies to hypersurface orthogonal geodesics,
 and the congruence emitted from 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is hypersurface orthogonal by Statement\InsetSpace ~

 Moreover, this congruence is integrable by Statement\InsetSpace ~

 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 is the point conjugate to 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 along 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

; other geodesics 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma'$

 may possess different conjugate points to 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $q$

\begin_inset Formula $q'$
\end_inset

, ..., to 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 along a single curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

.
 Thus the property of 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 to be conjugate to 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is a property of the local geometry around a selected geodesic 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 Note also that the focusing of geodesics does not yet indicate any singularitie
s in the spacetime; after all, we can select congruences that focus at any
 point by simply emitting geodesics from that point.

\begin_layout Standard
The focusing theorem (see Sec.\InsetSpace ~

) shows that 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{div}\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 will reach infinity within a finite proper time if the congruence initially
 has negative divergence and if the strong energy condition holds.
 Hence, conjugate points must exist along each curve of the congruence,
 under the same assumptions.

Second variation of proper length
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Derivation of geodesic equation}

\end_inset

 we have seen that a geodesic curve extremizes the proper length among all
 curves connecting two fixed points.
 For instance, in the Minkowski space, timelike geodesics 
\emph on
maximize
\emph default
 the proper time; note that spacelike geodesics do not 
\emph on
minimize
\emph default
 the proper distance, since the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 has the signature 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(+--\,-\right)$
\end_inset

.
 However, in more general spacetimes the proper length of a geodesic does
 not always deliver the maximum proper time.
 We shall now see that the maximization of proper length is closely related
 to the existence of conjugate points for neighbor geodesics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The infinitesimal change of the proper length of a curve under an infinitesimal
 variation is described by Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:geodesic pre deriv}

) of Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Derivation of geodesic equation}

 For a timelike curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)$
\end_inset

 with a tangent vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}=\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}$
\end_inset

 normalized by 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})=1$
\end_inset

, perturbed by the flow of a vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

 with a parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 along the flow, we have
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{d}{d\sigma}L[\gamma;\mathbf{t}]=-\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}g(\mathbf{t},\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{v})\textrm{d}\tau.\]

\end_inset

The derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $dL[\gamma;\mathbf{t}]/d\sigma$
\end_inset

 vanishes when 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 is a geodesic, but this is not sufficient to have an actual 
\emph on
maximum
\emph default
 of the functional 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

.
 The proper length is maximized if 
\begin_inset Formula $d^{2}L/d\sigma^{2}<0$
\end_inset

.
 To verify this condition, we again consider a vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 created by transporting the tangent vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}$
\end_inset

 along the orbits of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\frac{d^{2}}{d\sigma^{2}}L[\gamma;\mathbf{t}] & =-\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}\nabla_{\mathbf{t}}g(\mathbf{t},\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{v})\textrm{d}\tau\\
 & =-\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}g(\nabla_{\mathbf{t}}\mathbf{t},\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{v})\textrm{d}\tau-\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}g(\mathbf{t},\nabla_{\mathbf{t}}\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{v})\textrm{d}\tau.\end{align*}

\end_inset

 (Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{v}\neq0$
\end_inset

 away from the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

.) Since 
\begin_inset Formula $[\mathbf{v},\mathbf{t}]=0$
\end_inset

, the term 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{t}}\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is expressed through the Riemann tensor as
\begin_inset Formula \[
g(\mathbf{t},\nabla_{\mathbf{t}}\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{v})=R(\mathbf{t},\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v},\mathbf{t})+g(\mathbf{t},\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{t}).\]

\end_inset

Finally, on the geodesic curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{v}=0$
\end_inset

 and thus
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{d^{2}}{d\sigma^{2}}L[\gamma;\mathbf{t}]=\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}\left(R(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{t},\mathbf{v},\mathbf{t})-g(\mathbf{t},\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{t})\right)\textrm{d}\tau.\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The integral expression in the right-hand side above must be nonpositive
 for all vector fields 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

 (and for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

) if the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 maximizes the proper length under infinitesimal variations.
 We cannot simplify 
\begin_inset Formula $d^{2}L/d\sigma^{2}$
\end_inset

 any further, but we note that the expression in the right-hand side is
 similar to the geodesic deviation equation\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:geodesic deviation c u}

\end_inset

).
 Denoting by 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{G}$
\end_inset

 the linear operator involved in that equation, we can rewrite 
\begin_inset Formula $d^{2}L/d\sigma^{2}$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{d^{2}}{d\sigma^{2}}L[\gamma;\mathbf{t}]=\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}g(\mathbf{t},\hat{G}\mathbf{t}-\ddot{\mathbf{t}})\textrm{d}\tau,\]

\end_inset

where the precise definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{G}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{G}\mathbf{t}\equiv R(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{t})\mathbf{v},\quad\ddot{\mathbf{t}}\equiv\partial_{\tau}\partial_{\tau}\mathbf{t}\equiv\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{t}.\]

\end_inset

 The vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

 will be a Jacobi field if 
\begin_inset Formula $\ddot{\mathbf{t}}-\hat{G}\mathbf{t}=0$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $d^{2}L/d\sigma^{2}$
\end_inset

 will vanish if 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

 is a Jacobi field.
 In the present case, the field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

 plays the role of a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

perturbation field
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)$
\end_inset

 is fixed at endpoints 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau_{1})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau_{2})$
\end_inset

.
 Thus an admissible field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

 must vanish at endpoints.
 But a Jacobi field that vanishes at the endpoints can exist only if both
 endpoints are conjugate points with respect to the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

.
 The functional 
\begin_inset Formula $d^{2}L[\gamma;\mathbf{t}]/d\sigma^{2}$
\end_inset

 is a quadratic functional of the vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Heuristically, one expects that a negative-definite quadratic functional
 will not vanish at nonzero values of its argument.
 Hence, we expect that the proper length cannot be maximized if there exists
 a Jacobi field that vanishes at both the endpoints, or (as will be shown
 below) if one of the endpoints is conjugate to a point within the curve.
 Thus we found a crucial link between the existence of conjugate points
 and the maximization of proper length.
 This link is formalized in the following statement.

If there are no conjugate points then there is a one-to-one map between
 a Jacobi field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$

 at a point 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)$
\end_inset

 and the initial value of the derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=0$
\end_inset

 This map is specified by a nondegenerate transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $A(\tau)$
\end_inset

 The functional 
\begin_inset Formula $d^{2}L[\gamma;\mathbf{t}]/d\sigma^{2}$
\end_inset

 evaluated on an arbitrary vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

 can be expressed through the auxiliary vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{z}\equiv A^{-1}\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

, and shown to be a negative-definite functional of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{z}$
\end_inset

 by an explicit calculation that uses the integrability of the geodesic
 congruence emitted at 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau_{1})$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conversely, if there exists a focal point 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau_{*})$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{*}$
\end_inset

 is between 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{2}$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

, not identically zero, and such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}(\tau_{1})=\mathbf{c}(\tau_{*})=0$
\end_inset

.
 To show that the proper length is not maximized, it is sufficient to find
 even a single example of a vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $d^{2}L[\gamma;\mathbf{t}]/d\sigma^{2}>0$
\end_inset

 If we define the field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}_{0}$
\end_inset

 along the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}_{0}(\tau)\equiv\mathbf{c}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{1}<\tau<\tau_{*}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}_{0}(\tau)\equiv0$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{*}<\tau<\tau_{2}$

\begin_inset Formula $d^{2}L[\gamma;\mathbf{t}_{0}]/d\sigma^{2}=0$
\end_inset

 except at 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=\tau_{*}$

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}_{0}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 has a

 Now, one can deform this field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}_{0}(\tau)$

 by an infinitesimal amount and construct a smooth field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}(\tau)$

 such that still 
\begin_inset Formula $d^{2}L[\gamma;\mathbf{t}]/d\sigma^{2}>0$

 The construction of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 goes heuristically as follows: The field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 is almost equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 up to 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=\tau_{*}$
\end_inset

, which produces an almost zero value of the integral, and then 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 can be chosen to be almost zero for 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{*}<\tau<\tau_{2}$
\end_inset

 and such that the resulting integral is positive.

\begin_layout Subparagraph
More detailed proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First we prove that there is a maximum of 
\begin_inset Formula $L[\gamma]$
\end_inset

 if no conjugate points are present on 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

.
 For brevity, we denote (covariant) derivatives along the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 by an overdot.
 The time-dependent transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 that maps initial values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\mathbf{c}}(\tau_{1})$
\end_inset

 to final values 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 is the (transformation-valued) solution of the equation
\begin_inset Formula \[
\ddot{\hat{A}}-\hat{G}\hat{A}=0,\quad\hat{A}(\tau_{1})=0,\;\dot{\hat{A}}(\tau_{1})=\hat{1}.\]

\end_inset

Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{G}\mathbf{v}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\hat{G}\mathbf{x},\mathbf{v})=0$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

, in other words, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{G}$
\end_inset

 is transverse to the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{G}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 are effectively three-dimensional transformations acting in the subspace
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}^{\perp}$
\end_inset

.
 If there are no conjugate points, the transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 is nondegenerate for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau>\tau_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 In that case, we will now show that 
\begin_inset Formula $d^{2}L[\gamma;\mathbf{t}]/d\sigma^{2}\leq0$
\end_inset

 for all vector functions 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 that satisfy 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}(\tau_{1})=\mathbf{t}(\tau_{2})=0$
\end_inset

.
 This will be sufficient to show that 
\begin_inset Formula $L[\gamma]$
\end_inset

 has a maximum.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}^{-1}$
\end_inset

 is well-defined, we can set 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{z}(\tau)\equiv\hat{A}^{-1}(\tau)\mathbf{t}(\tau)$
\end_inset

; the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{z}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 will then belong to the subspace 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}^{\perp}$
\end_inset

.
 We can express 
\begin_inset Formula $d^{2}L[\gamma;\mathbf{t}]/d\sigma^{2}$
\end_inset

 through 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{z}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 as follows,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
\frac{d^{2}}{d\sigma^{2}}L[\gamma;\mathbf{t}] & =\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}g(\hat{A}\mathbf{z},\hat{G}\hat{A}\mathbf{z}-\partial_{\tau}\partial_{\tau}(\hat{A}\mathbf{z}))\textrm{d}\tau\nonumber \\
 & =\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}\left[-g(\hat{A}\mathbf{z},2\dot{\hat{A}}\dot{\mathbf{z}})-g(\hat{A}\mathbf{z},\hat{A}\ddot{\mathbf{z}})\right]\textrm{d}\tau\nonumber \\
 & =\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}\left[g(\dot{\hat{A}}\mathbf{z},\hat{A}\dot{\mathbf{z}})-g(\hat{A}\mathbf{z},\dot{\hat{A}}\dot{\mathbf{z}})+g(\hat{A}\dot{\mathbf{z}},\hat{A}\dot{\mathbf{z}}\right]\textrm{d}\tau,\label{eq:d2L gamma 1}\end{align}

\end_inset

where in the last line we have canceled the total derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{\tau}g(\hat{A}\mathbf{z},\hat{A}\dot{\mathbf{z}})$
\end_inset

.
 Now let us rewrite the first two terms in the last line in Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:d2L gamma 1}

\end_inset

) through the adjoint operator 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{T}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
g(\dot{\hat{A}}\mathbf{z},\hat{A}\dot{\mathbf{z}})-g(\hat{A}\mathbf{z},\dot{\hat{A}}\dot{\mathbf{z}})=g(\mathbf{z},(\dot{\hat{A}}^{T}\hat{A}-\hat{A}^{T}\dot{\hat{A}})\dot{\mathbf{z}}).\]

\end_inset

Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\hat{G}\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=R(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{v},\mathbf{y})$
\end_inset

, so the known symmetry of the Riemann tensor, 
\begin_inset Formula $R(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c},\mathbf{d})=R(\mathbf{c},\mathbf{d},\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})$
\end_inset

, means that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{G}$
\end_inset

 is self-adjoint, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{G}^{T}=\hat{G}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}^{T}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 satisfies the equation
\begin_inset Formula \[
\ddot{\hat{A}}^{T}-\hat{A}^{T}\hat{G}=0,\quad\hat{A}^{T}(\tau_{1})=0,\;\dot{\hat{A}}^{T}(\tau_{1})=\hat{1}.\]

\end_inset

The operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\hat{A}}^{T}\hat{A}-\hat{A}^{T}\dot{\hat{A}}$
\end_inset

 is analogous to a Wronskian and is time-independent because
\begin_inset Formula \[
\partial_{\tau}\left(\dot{\hat{A}}^{T}\hat{A}-\hat{A}^{T}\dot{\hat{A}}\right)=\hat{A}^{T}\hat{G}\hat{A}-\hat{A}^{T}\hat{G}\hat{A}=0.\]

\end_inset

Since the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\hat{A}}^{T}\hat{A}-\hat{A}^{T}\dot{\hat{A}}$
\end_inset

 is equal to zero at 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=\tau_{1}$
\end_inset

 due to the initial condition 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}(\tau_{1})=0$
\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\hat{A}}^{T}\hat{A}-\hat{A}^{T}\dot{\hat{A}}=0$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
 Thus
\begin_inset Formula \[
g(\dot{\hat{A}}\mathbf{z},\hat{A}\dot{\mathbf{z}})-g(\hat{A}\mathbf{z},\dot{\hat{A}}\dot{\mathbf{z}})\equiv0\]

\end_inset

and the expression\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:d2L gamma 1}

\end_inset

) is simplified to
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{d^{2}}{d\sigma^{2}}L[\gamma;\mathbf{t}]=\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}g(\hat{A}\dot{\mathbf{z}},\hat{A}\dot{\mathbf{z}})\textrm{d}\tau.\]

\end_inset

Since the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\dot{\mathbf{z}}$
\end_inset

 belongs to the subspace 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}^{\perp}$
\end_inset

, it is spacelike, hence the above expression is always nonpositive.

\begin_layout Standard
Now we consider the second case where a conjugate point is present.
 We will then show that 
\begin_inset Formula $L[\gamma]$

 The presence of a conjugate point means that there exists a Jacobi field

, with a small additional perturbation:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{t}(\tau)\equiv s(\tau)\mathbf{c}(\tau)+\varepsilon q(\tau)\mathbf{a},\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $s(\tau)$
\end_inset

 is a smooth step-like function such that 
\begin_inset Formula $s(\tau<\tau_{*})\approx1$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $s(\tau>\tau_{*})\approx0$

\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{1}<\tau<\tau_{2}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $q(\tau)=(\tau-\tau_{1})(\tau_{2}-\tau)$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 is a

 The function 
\begin_inset Formula $s(\tau)$
\end_inset

 is chosen to be nonconstant only within a very narrow interval around 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=\tau_{*}$
\end_inset

.
 The idea is to have 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 very small and 
\begin_inset Formula $s(\tau)$
\end_inset

 very close to the Heaviside step function, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}(\tau)$

 is smooth but 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}(\tau)\approx\mathbf{c}(\tau)$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}(\tau)\approx0$

 By construction, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}$
\end_inset

 exactly vanishes at the endpoints 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=\tau_{1,2}$

 With the above definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{t}(\tau)$

 terms of order 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon^{2}$

\hat{G}\mathbf{t}-\ddot{\mathbf{t}} & =\varepsilon q(\tau)\hat{G}\mathbf{a}-2\dot{s}\dot{\mathbf{c}}-\ddot{s}\mathbf{c},\\
\frac{d^{2}}{d\sigma^{2}}L[\gamma;\mathbf{t}] & =\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}g(\mathbf{t},\hat{G}\mathbf{t}-\ddot{\mathbf{t}})\textrm{d}\tau=-\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}g(s\mathbf{c},2\dot{s}\dot{\mathbf{c}}+\ddot{s}\mathbf{c})\textrm{d}\tau\\
 & -2\varepsilon\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}q(\tau)g(\mathbf{a},2\dot{s}\dot{\mathbf{c}}+\ddot{s}\mathbf{c})\textrm{d}\tau+O(\varepsilon^{2}),\end{align*}

\end_inset

where in the last line we have used the self-adjointness property (derived
 using integration by parts),
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}g(\mathbf{x},\hat{G}\mathbf{y}-\ddot{\mathbf{y}})\textrm{d}\tau=\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}g(\hat{G}\mathbf{x}-\ddot{\mathbf{x}},\mathbf{y})\textrm{d}\tau,\]

\end_inset

which holds for vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 that vanish at endpoints 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=\tau_{1,2}$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{s}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\ddot{s}$
\end_inset

 are nonzero only in a narrow interval around 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=\tau_{*}$
\end_inset

, it is sufficient to approximate
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\mathbf{c}(\tau) & \approx\left(\tau-\tau_{*}\right)\mathbf{b},\quad\mathbf{b}\equiv\dot{\mathbf{c}}(\tau_{*})\\
\mathbf{t}(\tau) & \approx\left(\tau-\tau_{*}\right)s(\tau)\mathbf{b}+\varepsilon q(\tau_{*})\mathbf{a},\end{align*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 is a known spacelike vector.
 (With a suitable choice of the function 
\begin_inset Formula $s(\tau)$
\end_inset

, the error of this approximation will be of order 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon^{2}$
\end_inset

.) Therefore,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\frac{\textrm{d}^{2}L[\mathbf{t}]}{\textrm{d}\sigma^{2}} & =O(\varepsilon^{2})-g(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{b})\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}(\tau-\tau_{*})\left(2s\dot{s}+(\tau-\tau_{*})s\ddot{s}\right)\textrm{d}\tau\\
 & -2\varepsilon q(\tau_{*})g(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}\negmedspace\left(2\dot{s}+(\tau-\tau_{*})\ddot{s}\right)\textrm{d}\tau.\end{align*}

\end_inset

The step-like function 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 can be chosen so that the first integral in the above equation is arbitrarily
 small, e.g.\InsetSpace ~
of order 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Indeed, integration by parts yields
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}(\tau-\tau_{*})\left(2s\dot{s}+(\tau-\tau_{*})s\ddot{s}\right)\textrm{d}\tau=-\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}(\tau-\tau_{*})^{2}\dot{s}^{2}\textrm{d}\tau;\]

\end_inset

 heuristically, 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{s}(\tau)\approx\delta(\tau-\tau_{*})$
\end_inset

 and thus 
\begin_inset Formula $(\tau-\tau_{*})\dot{s}\approx0$
\end_inset

.
 These statements can be made mathematically precise, for instance, by using
 an explicit formula for 
\begin_inset Formula $s(\tau)$
\end_inset

.
 The remaining integral is easily evaluated,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}\left(2\dot{s}+(\tau-\tau_{*})\ddot{s}\right)\textrm{d}\tau=\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}\left[\dot{s}+\partial_{\tau}\left((\tau-\tau_{*})\dot{s}\right)\right]\textrm{d}\tau=-1.\]

\end_inset

Finally, we note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}\neq0$
\end_inset

, since by assumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 is not everywhere zero and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}=\dot{\mathbf{c}}\neq0$
\end_inset

 at the point 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=\tau_{*}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}=0$
\end_inset

.
 Also, 
\begin_inset Formula $q(\tau_{*})>0$
\end_inset

.
 So we can choose the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
2q(\tau_{*})g(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})=1.\]

\end_inset

 With this choice, we obtain
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{d^{2}}{d\sigma^{2}}L[\gamma;\mathbf{t}]=\varepsilon+O(\varepsilon^{2}),\]

\end_inset

which will be positive for small enough 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

.
 This concludes the proof of Statement\InsetSpace ~

Thus, in the presence of (at least one) conjugate point on a curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$

\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$

 For example, a body on a circular orbit in a central gravitational field
 does not maximize the proper time over one period after it comes back to
 an initial point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 In fact, the proper time is maximized by another geodesic, corresponding

 If a maximizing geodesic exists, it must be one of the congruence normal

 However, if the proper length of

An example of this situation is a half-hyperboloid 
\begin_inset Formula $t^{2}-r^{2}=1$

\begin_inset Formula $t<0$

 This spacelike 3-surface is orthogonal to every straight line (i.e.\InsetSpace ~

 Thus, the origin is the focal point for all the geodesics emitted orthogonally
 from 
\begin_inset Formula $S$

 The half-lightcone, 
\begin_inset Formula $t^{2}-r^{2}=0$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $t<0$

 For any point 
\begin_inset Formula $q$

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $t^{2}-r^{2}>0$

\begin_inset Formula $t\leq0$

 Thus, the maximal-length curve connecting some point

Solution:

 The hyperboloid is specified by the equation 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x})=1$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\equiv(t,x,y,z)$
\end_inset

 is the position vector.
 The future-directed normal vector field is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{u}=-\frac{\mathbf{x}}{\sqrt{g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x})}},\]

\end_inset

 and the Levi-Civita connection 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla=\partial$
\end_inset

, so we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 and thus (on the surface)
\begin_inset Formula \[
\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{u}=-\partial_{\mathbf{a}}\frac{\mathbf{x}}{\sqrt{g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x})}}=-\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{x}g(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{x}).\]

\end_inset

 The divergence is found as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\textrm{div}\mathbf{u} & =\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})}g(\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{u},\mathbf{b})\\
 & =\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})}\left[g(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{x})g(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{x})-g(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})\right]=1-4=-3.\end{align*}

\end_inset

So we may set 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{0}=3$
\end_inset

 The proper length to the focus is 
\begin_inset Formula $3/\theta_{0}=1$

Finally, we state an analogous theorem for null geodesics.
 The differences between the timelike and the null case are purely technical:
 1) Jacobi fields for null geodesics
\series bold
 
\series default

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 are effectively two-dimensional because connecting vectors differing by
 a multiple of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 are equivalent.
 2) Null geodesics containing conjugate points do not maximize the proper
 length between endpoints, thus the maximal proper length is positive, and
 there is a timelike curve connecting the endpoints.
 3) One considers a spacelike 2-surface to which null geodesics are orthogonal
 (note that there are two null directions orthogonal to a spacelike 2-surface,
 but no null vectors orthogonal to a spacelike 3-surface).
 4) One uses the null energy condition instead of the strong energy condition.
 5) The focusing theorem for null geodesics predicts focusing within parameter

\begin_inset Formula $2/\theta_{0}$

\begin_inset Formula $3/\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

 in the timelike case.

An intuitive picture of a gravitational collapse is that of a cloud of particles
 that keep moving closer to each other.
 The mathematical expression of this property is that the congruence of
 the particle worldlines has a negative divergence.
 According to the focusing theorem, a consequence of negative divergence
 is a focusing of the geodesics.
 As a result, the geodesics fail to maximize proper length.
 This is the technical basis of the singularity theorems.
 Of course, the geodesic focusing by itself does not signal any singularities;
 we need additional conditions on the initial velocities of the particles
 to conclude that singularities will develop.
 In the first singularity theorem, these conditions are formulated as requiremen

 Timelike geodesics intersecting

 We can select

 at a point 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{\infty}$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{\infty}$
\end_inset

 must be an accumulation point for 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ q_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 Hence the proper length of 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{\infty}$
\end_inset

 cannot be less than 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 and so 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{\infty}\in I(\Sigma;p;L)$
\end_inset

.
 This yields a contradiction with the assumption that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ q_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 has no accumulation points within 
\begin_inset Formula $I(\Sigma;p;L$
\end_inset

).
 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{\infty}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 cannot intersect 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

.
 Since every timelike curve intersects 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

, we see that the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}_{\infty}$
\end_inset

 must be null and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{\infty}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 is a null geodesic.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{\infty}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 does not intersect 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

, for any 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 there exists a neighborhood of 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{\infty}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 that does not intersect 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

.
 It is then possible to find a timelike curve (which is not necessarily
 a geodesic, not necessarily starting at 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

) that runs along 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{\infty}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 and always remains away from 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

.
 The existence of an inextendible timelike curve that never crosses 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 contradicts the definition of a Cauchy surface.
 This concludes the proof.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An interpretation of the first theorem is the following: If we see a universe
 that is everywhere contracting (everywhere along a single Cauchy surface),
 we should expect to hit a singularity within a finite time.
 By inverting the direction of time, we also come to the conclusion that
 a Cauchy surface with everywhere positive divergence contains a singularity
 in its past.
 Thus, if our universe is everywhere expanding, and if the strong or the
 null energy condition is satisfied, then the universe must have begun at
 a singularity at a finite time in the past.

The assumption that a given 3-surface is a Cauchy surface for the spacetime

 Here is how this conclusion can be derived.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We restrict our attention to the part of the spacetime consisting of points
 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 for which there exists a timelike curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$

\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$

 We would like to prove that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{D}(\Sigma)$
\end_inset

 contains some incomplete geodesics if 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 satisfies the conditions of Statement\InsetSpace ~
1 above, except for being a Cauchy
 surface.
 It follows from the proof of Statement\InsetSpace ~
1 that, within 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{D}(\Sigma)$
\end_inset

, a geodesic 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 connecting 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 to a point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $>3/\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

 does not maximize the proper length.
 Therefore, any geodesic that 
\emph on
does
\emph default
 maximize the proper length must be shorter than 
\begin_inset Formula $3/\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}(\Sigma)\equiv\partial\mathcal{D}(\Sigma)$
\end_inset

 the boundary of the domain of dependence; it is a 3-surface called the
 
\series bold
Cauchy horizon
\series default
.
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{Cauchy horizon}

\end_inset

It can be seen that the Cauchy horizon 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}(\Sigma)$
\end_inset

 is locally a null surface (although it may also contain some 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

corners
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 The fact that a boundary 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial\mathcal{D}$
\end_inset

 of a domain of dependence 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{D}$
\end_inset

 is a null 3-surface will be derived below (see the proof of Statement\InsetSpace ~
1
 in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Hawking's-area-theorem}

\end_inset

).
 There are now two interesting possibilities: either 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}(\Sigma)$
\end_inset

 is compact, or it is not compact.
 Suppose first that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}(\Sigma)$
\end_inset

 is a compact set.
 Note that a null surface is generated by null geodesics (see Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Null-functions-generate}

\end_inset

).
 Then the null generators of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}(\Sigma)$
\end_inset

 must wind around it, coming arbitrarily near to themselves infinitely many
 times; informally, we may call such curves 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

almost closed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 curves.
 Since timelike geodesics can be found arbitrarily close to null geodesics,
 the presence of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

almost closed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 null geodesics is an undesirable feature of the spacetime, similar to a
 causality violation or the presence of a time machine.
 A spacetime is called 
\series bold
strongly causal
\series default
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{strongly causal spacetime}

\end_inset

if it does not admit timelike curves that repeatedly come arbitrarily close
 to some points.
 Therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}(\Sigma)$
\end_inset

 cannot be compact in a strongly causal spacetime.
 Now suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}(\Sigma)$
\end_inset

 is not compact; then 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}(\Sigma)$
\end_inset

 contains a sequence of points 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{2}$
\end_inset

, ..., which does not have an accumulation point within 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}(\Sigma)$
\end_inset

.
 We may choose a sequence of points 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \tilde{q}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 arbitrarily close to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ q_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 but within 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{D}(\Sigma)$
\end_inset

.
 Then, every point 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{q}_{j}$
\end_inset

 lies on at least one timelike curve intersecting 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

.
 Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is the length of that curve; then the set of all timelike curves with length
 
\begin_inset Formula $\geq L$
\end_inset

 is compact, so one of these curves has the largest proper length.
 So, for each point 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{q}_{j}$
\end_inset

 we have a timelike geodesic 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{j}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 that has the maximal proper length among all the timelike curves connecting
 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{q}_{j}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

.
 (We have already shown that each of these curves has proper length 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau_{\max}<3/\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

, assuming that 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{j}(0)$
\end_inset

 is on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

.) Let 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{j}$
\end_inset

 be the point where the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{j}$
\end_inset

 intersects 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

, and let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{j}\equiv\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}_{j}(0)$
\end_inset

 be the initial tangent vector.
 The intersection points 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}$
\end_inset

, ..., and the corresponding initial tangent vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{2}$
\end_inset

, ..., are sequences on a compact set 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 and thus must accumulate at some point 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\infty}$
\end_inset

 and vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{\infty}$
\end_inset

.
 Now, we can show that the geodesic 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{\infty}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 emitted from 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\infty}$
\end_inset

 with the initial tangent vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{\infty}$
\end_inset

 cannot be extended past the proper time 
\begin_inset Formula $3/\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{\infty}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 were well-defined for 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau>3/\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

 then we would have a narrow tube-shaped neighborhood stretching along 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{\infty}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $0<\tau\leq3/\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

, such that infinitely many geodesics 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{j}$
\end_inset

 are inside that tube.
 Thus the point sequences 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \tilde{q}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 and therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ q_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 would accumulate somewhere within the (compact) neighborhood of 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{\infty}$
\end_inset

.
 This contradicts the assumption that the sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ q_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 has no accumulation points.

 The collapse results in a singularity, regardless of the composition of

\begin_layout Standard
In this section we shall consider a singularity theorem due to Penrose,
 showing that the formation of a singularity is inevitable once the normally
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

outgoing

\end_inset

 lightrays start to converge.
 Let us investigate this condition in more detail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There exist precisely two null directions orthogonal to a 2-dimensional
 subspace spanned by two spacelike vectors.
 Thus, a spacelike 2-surface can emit two congruences of lightrays orthogonal
 to it.
 Normally, one congruence will be converging (the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ingoing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 lightrays) and the other diverging (the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

outgoing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 lightrays).
 A 2-surface 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is called a 
\series bold
trapped surface
\series default
 if both congruences of lightrays emitted orthogonally to 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 into the future have a negative divergence.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Penrose's argument begins by considering a spherically symmetric distribution
 of matter.
 Suppose at first that a mass 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is concentrated within a region of radius 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{0}<2m$
\end_inset

 in a spherically symmetric fashion.
 Then the metric outside of the matter distribution is Schwarzschild, and
 it is easy to see that at points 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{0}<r<2m$
\end_inset

, both lightcones emitted into the future direction are converging (have
 negative divergence).
 Thus a sphere of radius 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{1}$
\end_inset

 is a compact, spacelike, trapped 2-surface for 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{0}<r_{1}<2m$
\end_inset

.
 We shall shortly prove that the existence of such a trapped 2-surface indicates
 the presence of a singularity in the future.
 Now, if the matter distribution is slightly nonspherical, the sphere will
 remain a trapped surface because the divergence of the lightrays will be
 only slightly perturbed and will not become positive.
 Thus a singularity arises even for asymmetric configurations of collapsing
 matter.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

future subdomain
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}(T)$
\end_inset

 of the surface 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

; this subdomain consists of all the points 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 that can be connected to 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 by some timelike curve.
 The proof of the theorem is based on studying the properties of the boundary
 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial\mathcal{F}(T)$
\end_inset

 of the subdomain 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}(T)$
\end_inset

.
 By considering geodesics near 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

, it is easy to see that the 3-surface 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 starts from 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 as a null surface made by null geodesics emitted orthogonally from 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is compact, the everywhere negative divergence of null geodesics emitted
 from 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 has an upper bound 
\begin_inset Formula $-\theta_{0}<0$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, by the focussing theorem, every null geodesic will have a conjugate
 point to 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 within a finite interval of the affine parameter (not larger than 
\begin_inset Formula $2\theta_{0}^{-1}$
\end_inset

).
 Let us assume that every null geodesic to the future of 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is complete; in particular, extendable beyond the parameter interval 
\begin_inset Formula $2\theta_{0}^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 We know that a geodesic does not maximize proper length beyond a conjugate
 point; therefore, points 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 on null geodesics beyond 
\begin_inset Formula $2\theta_{0}^{-1}$
\end_inset

 can be connected with 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 by a timelike geodesic with positive proper length.
 Thus, points on null geodesics beyond 
\begin_inset Formula $2\theta_{0}^{-1}$
\end_inset

 are inside 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}(T)$
\end_inset

, and so the boundary 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 consists of finite segments of null geodesics, each segment not longer
 than 
\begin_inset Formula $2\theta_{0}^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is compact, the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 can be viewed as a subset of a compact set 
\begin_inset Formula $T\times[0,2\theta_{0}^{-1}]$
\end_inset

, therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 is itself compact.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 is time-orientable, there exists a smooth vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})=1$
\end_inset

.
 By definition of the Cauchy surface, every orbit of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 intersects 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}$
\end_inset

 exactly once.
 Also, an orbit of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 can intersect the 3-surface 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 at most once; this follows from the definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 as the boundary of the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}(T)$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, the orbits of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 define a map from 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}$
\end_inset

: a point 
\begin_inset Formula $p\in\partial\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 is mapped into the intersection of the corresponding timelike curve with
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}$
\end_inset

.
 This map is continuous and one-to-one between 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 and its image; however, 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 is compact while 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}$
\end_inset

 is not, which is an impossible situation.
 (The image of 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 must be a compact subset of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}$
\end_inset

, so it must have a nonempty boundary within 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}$
\end_inset

 which will be mapped to a boundary of 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

, and yet the boundary of 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 is empty since 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial\partial=0$
\end_inset

.) Therefore we must reject the assumption that all null geodesics can be
 extended beyond 
\begin_inset Formula $2\theta_{0}^{-1}$
\end_inset

; in other words, there must exist an incomplete null geodesic to the future
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $T$

\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{t}$
\end_inset

 is divergence-free because the cross-section area of the null surface 
\begin_inset Formula $r=2m$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $4\pi r^{2}$
\end_inset

 and thus remains constant along 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{t}$
\end_inset

 (see Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Divergence-of-a-null}

\end_inset

 and the example in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Examples-of-null}

\end_inset

).
 Now consider the case 
\begin_inset Formula $r\neq2m$
\end_inset

.
 To compute the divergence of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

, it is convenient to use a basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{l},\mathbf{n},\mathbf{e}_{\theta},\mathbf{e}_{\phi}\right\} $
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{l}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 are null and 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{l},\mathbf{n})=1$
\end_inset

, while the spacelike basis vectors are 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{\theta}=r^{-1}\partial_{\theta}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{\phi}=(r\sin\theta)^{-1}\partial_{\phi}$
\end_inset

, in spherical coordinates.
 The vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 should be an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

outward
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 radial geodesic while 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{l}$
\end_inset

 points along the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

inward
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 lightray (but is not necessarily an affine tangent vector to it).
 After we compute the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{l}$
\end_inset

, it will follow that 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\textrm{div}\mathbf{n} & =\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})}g(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{n},\mathbf{y})\\
 & =g(\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}\mathbf{n},\mathbf{l})+g(\nabla_{\mathbf{l}}\mathbf{n},\mathbf{n})-g(\nabla_{\mathbf{e}_{\theta}}\mathbf{n},\mathbf{e}_{\theta})-g(\nabla_{\mathbf{e}_{\phi}}\mathbf{n},\mathbf{e}_{\phi})\\
 & =g([\mathbf{n,}\mathbf{e}_{\theta}],\mathbf{e}_{\theta})+g([\mathbf{n,}\mathbf{e}_{\phi}],\mathbf{e}_{\phi}).\end{align*}

\end_inset

 Now let us determine 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{l}$
\end_inset

.
 Denote by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
z(r)\equiv\left(1-\frac{2m}{r}\right)^{1/2}\]

\end_inset

the redshift factor for the Schwarzschild spacetime (see Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Redshift}

\end_inset

).
 Assuming that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{n}=\alpha_{1}\partial_{t}+\alpha_{2}\partial_{r},\quad\mathbf{l}=\beta_{1}\partial_{t}+\beta_{2}\partial_{r},\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{1,2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{1,2}$
\end_inset

 are unknown scalar functions, we use the conditions
\begin_inset Formula \[
g(\mathbf{l},\mathbf{l})=g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{n})=0,\quad g(\mathbf{l},\mathbf{n})=1,\]

\end_inset

and find
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
z^{2}\alpha_{1}^{2} & =\frac{1}{z^{2}}\alpha_{2}^{2},\quad,z^{2}\beta_{1}^{2}=\frac{1}{z^{2}}\beta_{2}^{2},\\
z^{2}\alpha_{1}\beta_{1} & -\frac{1}{z^{2}}\alpha_{2}\beta_{2}=1;\end{align*}

\end_inset

thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{1,2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{1,2}$
\end_inset

 may be chosen as functions only of 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

.
 Further, we have
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\mathbf{l},\mathbf{n}\right]=\beta_{2}\left(\alpha_{1}^{\prime}\partial_{t}+\alpha_{2}^{\prime}\partial_{r}\right)-\alpha_{2}\left(\beta_{1}^{\prime}\partial_{t}+\beta_{2}^{\prime}\partial_{r}\right),\]

\end_inset

where the prime 
\begin_inset Formula $^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 denotes derivatives with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

.
 Using the condition
\begin_inset Formula \[
0=g(\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}\mathbf{n},\mathbf{l})=-g(\mathbf{n},\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}\mathbf{l})=g(\mathbf{n},[\mathbf{l},\mathbf{n}]),\]

\end_inset

we find
\begin_inset Formula \[
z^{2}\alpha_{1}\left(\alpha_{1}^{\prime}\beta_{2}-\alpha_{2}\beta_{1}^{\prime}\right)-\frac{1}{z^{2}}\alpha_{2}\left(\alpha_{2}^{\prime}\beta_{2}-\alpha_{2}\beta_{2}^{\prime}\right)=0.\]

\end_inset

Thus the four equations determine the unknown functions 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{1,2},\beta_{1,2}$
\end_inset

.
 A solution is (up to a constant)
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{n}=\frac{1}{z^{2}}\partial_{t}\pm\partial_{r},\quad\mathbf{l}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\partial_{t}\mp z^{2}\partial_{r}\right),\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the sign of 
\begin_inset Formula $z^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Finally, we compute the commutators
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
[\mathbf{n},\mathbf{e}_{\theta}] & =\pm[\partial_{r},\mathbf{e}_{\theta}]=\pm[\partial_{r},\frac{1}{r}\partial_{\theta}]=\mp\frac{1}{r}\mathbf{e}_{\theta},\\
{}[\mathbf{n},\mathbf{e}_{\phi}] & =\pm[\partial_{r},\frac{1}{r\sin\theta}\partial_{\phi}]=\mp\frac{1}{r}\mathbf{e}_{\phi},\end{align*}

\end_inset

and therefore
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{div}\mathbf{n}=\pm\frac{2}{r}.\]

\end_inset

This means that the divergence of an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

outward
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

-pointing, future-directed null congruence is positive for 
\begin_inset Formula $r>2m$
\end_inset

 and negative for 
\begin_inset Formula $r<2m$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the notion of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

escaping to infinity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is well-defined if the spacetime is asymptotically flat (a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

neighborhood of infinity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is the place where the spacetime becomes almost Minkowski, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
a neighborhood
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr I^{+}$
\end_inset

 on a conformal diagram).
 Generalizations of this notion exist for non-asymptotically flat cases,
 such as the de Sitter spacetime.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Heuristically, the set

\end_inset

 of all such points is interpreted as a

 For a point 
\begin_inset Formula $p\not\in\mathcal{B}$

\begin_inset Formula $p$

 there exists a neighborhood of 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 which is not in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

 Thus the set

 is closed, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}\subset\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

 The horizon 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

 from the domain of spacetime from which timelike curves

 Thus, the horizon 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}$

 can also be thought of as the boundary of the past domain of dependence
 of the future null infinity 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr I^{+}$
\end_inset

.
 Let us study the properties of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}$
\end_inset

 in more detail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first important property of an event horizon is stated by a theorem
 due to R.
 Penrose.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Statement 1:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An event horizon is a null surface whose generators are null geodesics without
 future endpoints, except if a generator hits a singularity.
 (Generators cannot leave 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}$
\end_inset

 and enter the interior of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By construction, there cannot exist any future-directed timelike curves
 crossing 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}$
\end_inset

 from its interior 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

 outwards; also, for any point 
\begin_inset Formula $p\not\in\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

 there should exist at least one timelike curve not crossing 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}$
\end_inset

.
 It follows from these requirements that the 3-surface 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}$
\end_inset

 cannot be locally timelike (i.e.\InsetSpace ~
spanned by one timelike and two spacelike
 directions).
 Also, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}$
\end_inset

 cannot be spacelike, because a spacelike 3-surface separates a past subdomain
 from a future subdomain, so the future of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}$
\end_inset

 would have to be within 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

, but then some points to the past of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}$
\end_inset

 will be unable to emit signals that do not enter 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore,
\emph on
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}$
\end_inset


\emph default
 must be a null surface, except for points where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}$
\end_inset

 has a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

corner
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 so the tangent 3-space to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}$
\end_inset

 is undefined.
 A null surface locally separates a past subdomain from a future subdomain,
 and it is clear that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

 must be on the future side from 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}$
\end_inset

.
 We also know that null surface is generated by null geodesics (see Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Null-functions-generate}

\end_inset

).
 Suppose that a null generator 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 had an endpoint 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

, and consider the causal structure of the tangent space at 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 We are assuming that 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is not a singularity, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 can be continued past 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 It is clear that 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 cannot exit 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

; thus, since 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 leaves 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}$
\end_inset

, it must enter the interior of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

.
 There exists a point 
\begin_inset Formula $p'\not\in\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

 infinitesimally displaced to the past of 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

, and there exists at least one null curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma'$
\end_inset

 starting from 
\begin_inset Formula $p'$
\end_inset

 which escapes to infinity (or else we would have no timelike curves from
 
\begin_inset Formula $p'$
\end_inset

 escaping to infinity, contradicting the assumption 
\begin_inset Formula $p'\not\in\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

).
 Therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma'$
\end_inset

 can never cross 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}$
\end_inset

.
 However, the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma'$
\end_inset

 is arbitrarily close to 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

, hence it enters 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

.
 This contradiction proves that 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 cannot have an endpoint.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The condition that singularities do not occur at the horizon is motivated
 as follows.
 We expect that the future history of an asymptotically flat spacetime is
 completely predictable from initial data on a Cauchy 3-surface 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}$
\end_inset

 preceding the gravitational collapse.
 Thus, any null curve escaping to infinity must intersect 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}$
\end_inset

 at one point.
 (This condition is called 
\series bold
asymptotic predictability
\series default
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{asymptotic predictability}

\end_inset

with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}$
\end_inset

.) If a null generator 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 of a horizon 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}$
\end_inset

 stops at a singularity 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

, it means that the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 cannot be continued past 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 Since there exist null curves 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma'\not\subset\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

 infinitely close to 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 and reaching infinity, it follows that there exists a (null and/or spacelike)
 curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma''$
\end_inset

 that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

starts
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 at the singularity 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and reaches infinity.
 To an observer at infinity, this curve appears to be a past-directed curve
 that stops at 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma''$
\end_inset

 does not intersect 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}$
\end_inset

 and the asymptotic behavior at infinity in the direction of 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma''$
\end_inset

 cannot be predicted from initial data on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}$
\end_inset

.
 Another way to express this is to say that the singularity is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

directly visible
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to an observer at infinity.
 There is a (so far, not proved but strongly supported) conjecture that
 any singularities that can occur in reasonable physical processes, such
 as gravitational collapse, must be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hidden
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 behind event horizons and are thus invisible to observers at infinity.
 This statement is called the

 There are some artificial examples of spacetimes with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

naked
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 singularities, but all such examples are pathological in one or another
 way.
 Therefore, the assumption of asymptotic predictability appears reasonable.

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 We have seen in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Divergence-of-a-null}

 that the cross-section area 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

\begin_inset Formula \[
\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}A=\left(\textrm{div}\mathbf{n}\right)A,\]

if the null 3-surface has generators 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$

 In Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Examples-of-null}

\end_inset

 we showed that the Schwarzschild horizon is a null surface whose generators
 are 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}=\partial_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Since the total area of the Schwarzschild horizon in the stationary reference
 frame is time-independent, 
\begin_inset Formula $A=4\pi r^{2}$
\end_inset

, the field 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{t}$
\end_inset

 has zero divergence.
 In a general, nonstationary spacetime containing black holes, the area
 of a horizon 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}$
\end_inset

 may change with time (i.e.\InsetSpace ~
with the choice of the Cauchy surface 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}$

), and thus the divergence of the null generators 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}$
\end_inset

 may be nonzero.
 However, it turns out that the divergence of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 cannot be negative, so the area cannot diminish with time.

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{div}\mathbf{n}<0$

 By the focusing theorem, the null generators of

 After focusing, some point

 A timelike curve starting at

 must be completely within 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{B}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $p\in\mathcal{B}$

 Thus, the point

 will be inside

 any more.
 Thus, a null geodesic 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$

\end_inset

Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider first the intersection 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}\cap\mathcal{C}_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 A portion of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}$
\end_inset

 between 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}_{2}$
\end_inset

 will be generated by null geodesics emitted from 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}\cap\mathcal{C}_{1}$
\end_inset

 to the future.
 Since each generator has no endpoints on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}$
\end_inset

, it must intersect 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}_{2}$
\end_inset

 by the Cauchy surface property of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 The intersection of the generators with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}_{2}$
\end_inset

 will have an area not smaller than 
\begin_inset Formula $A[\mathcal{H}\cap\mathcal{C}_{1}]$
\end_inset

, since these geodesics have everywhere nonnegative divergence.
 There is also a possibility that other disconnected pieces of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}$
\end_inset

 will have formed between 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}_{2}$
\end_inset

; this would only increase the total area 
\begin_inset Formula $A[\mathcal{H}\cap\mathcal{C}_{2}]$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula $A[\mathcal{H}\cap\mathcal{C}_{2}]\geq A[\mathcal{H}\cap\mathcal{C}_{1}]$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
The area theorem has had a wide-reaching impact on all of fundamental physics.
 It has lead to the hypothesis of black hole entropy, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
S=\frac{1}{4}A=4\pi m^{2},\]

\end_inset

 and to the holographic principle.
 Let us consider a simple application of the area theorem.
 In an asymptotically flat spacetime containing two distant black holes
 with masses 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{2}$
\end_inset

, there may be some process that lets the two black holes come closer together
 and eventually merge.
 Initially, the total area of the event horizon of this spacetime is 
\begin_inset Formula $16\pi(m_{1}^{2}+m_{2}^{2})$
\end_inset

.
 After merging, the spacetime contains a larger black hole of mass 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

, with the area of the event horizon 
\begin_inset Formula $16\pi M^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 The area theorem says that 
\begin_inset Formula $16\pi M^{2}\geq16\pi(m_{1}^{2}+m_{2}^{2})$
\end_inset

 regardless of the details of the merger, and regardless of whether any
 extra matter or radiation was absorbed or emitted in the process of merging.
 This inequality sets a fundamental bound on the amount of energy that can
 be extracted from a black hole merger.

In the lecture, I covered: general ideas behind the Generalized Second Law

\begin_layout Standard
A rough map of ideas: Black holes must contain entropy for the 2nd law to
 hold.
 Hawking's area theorem supports the identification of entropy and the horizon
 area.
 Assuming that black hole is the highest-entropy state, we obtain a bound
 on the entropy of matter within a (spacelike) 2-sphere.
 Since entropy counts the internal states, there is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

enough space

 on the boundary of a region to encode all the possible states within the
 region; hence the term

holography.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Bousso's covariant entropy bound is a generalization of this bound that
 remains valid in more complicated situations, and yields the spacelike
 bound as a particular case if appropriate conditions hold.
 Presently, the holographic principle has the status of a strongly supported
 conjecture.

 The commonly used variational principle states that the equation of motion

 The Hamiltonian formulation of field dynamics is then derived from the
 Lagrangian formulation.
 In this chapter we shall examine Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations

 The variation of the action under a small change

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The currently established field theories (electrodynamics, gravitation,
 weak and strong interactions) are described by Lagrangian densities which
 depend only on the fields and their first derivatives, 
\begin_inset Formula $L=L\left(\phi^{j},\phi_{,\mu}^{j}\right)$
\end_inset

 For such Lagrangians, the first-order variation of the action is given
 by the formula 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\delta S=\int_{\mathcal{M}}\textrm{d}^{4}x\sum_{j}\left(\frac{\partial L\left(\phi^{i},\nabla\phi^{i}\right)}{\partial\phi^{j}}-\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\mu}}\frac{\partial L\left(\phi^{i},\nabla\phi^{i}\right)}{\partial\phi_{,\mu}^{j}}\right)\delta\phi^{j}(x),\]

\end_inset

where the summation over 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 is implied.
 The boundary terms vanish if 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{j}\frac{\partial L}{\partial\phi_{,\mu}^{j}}\delta\phi^{j}\rightarrow0\;\textrm{sufficiently rapidly as}\;\left|\mathbf{x}\right|\rightarrow\infty,\:\left|t\right|\rightarrow\infty,\]

\end_inset

 which is the usual assumption.
 Thus we obtain the following Euler-Lagrange equations for the fields 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi^{j}$

\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}

\begin_layout Standard
The formula\InsetSpace ~
(

 If a Lagrangian for a field 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 contains second-order derivatives such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{;\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

, the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations will generally contain derivatives
 of third and fourth order.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a classical field theory is to be compatible with general relativity,
 the Lagrangian must be generally covariant.
 In practice, this means that the Lagrangian should be an invariant combination
 of covariant derivatives of fields and the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

.
 The integration must be performed with the volume element 
\begin_inset Formula $d^{4}x\sqrt{-g}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $g\equiv\det\left(g_{\mu\nu}\right)$
\end_inset

 is the determinant of the covariant metric tensor.
 Normally, this factor is included into the Lagrangian

Covariant volume element

\begin_layout Standard
The expression 
\begin_inset Formula $d^{4}x$

\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 are not Cartesian or if the spacetime is curved.
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{covariant volume element}

\end_inset

It is not difficult to show that the volume element in any number of dimensions
 is given by the formula 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}V=\textrm{d}^{n}x\sqrt{\left|g(x)\right|}$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{1}$
\end_inset

, ..., 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{n}$
\end_inset

 are some vectors in a Euclidean space, let 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{ij}\equiv\mathbf{u}_{i}\cdot\mathbf{u}_{j}$
\end_inset

 be the 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times n$
\end_inset

 matrix of their pairwise scalar products.
 Then the volume of the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-dimensional parallelepiped spanned by the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{i}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $V=\sqrt{\left|\det G\right|}$
\end_inset

.
 We can prove this standard statement by considering the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{i}^{j}$
\end_inset

 of components of the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{i}$
\end_inset

 in an orthonormal basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

, i.e.
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{u}_{i}=\sum_{j}U_{i}^{j}\mathbf{e}_{j}.\]

\end_inset

 The matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 can be also understood as a linear transformation that maps the unit parallelep
iped spanned by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 to a parallelepiped spanned by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{u}_{i}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 A standard definition of the determinant of a linear transformation is
 the volume of the image of a unit parallelepiped after the transformation.
 Therefore, the volume 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $V=\det U$
\end_inset

.
 Then we observe that the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{ij}$
\end_inset

 satisfies 
\begin_inset Formula $G=U^{T}U$
\end_inset

, therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $\det G=(\det U)^{2}=V^{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V=\sqrt{\left|\det G\right|}$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Standard
In general relativity, the spacetime has a metric with signature 
\begin_inset Formula $(+,-,-,-)$
\end_inset

 and the determinant 
\begin_inset Formula $\det g_{\mu\nu}$

 is always negative (except at singular points where it may be zero or infinite).
 Therefore we change the sign of 
\begin_inset Formula $g$

 and write the volume element as 
\begin_inset Formula $d^{4}x\sqrt{-g}$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When computing the variation of a generally covariant action such as the
 action\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:S scalar min}

\end_inset

), one needs to integrate by parts.
 A useful shortcut in such calculations is an analog of Gauss's law with
 covariant derivatives.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The covariant divergence of a vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 can be written as
\begin_inset Formula \[
A_{\,;\mu}^{\mu}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{-g}}\partial_{\mu}\left(\sqrt{-g}A^{\mu}\right).\]

\end_inset

 The formula analogous to the Gauss law is
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int_{V}A^{\mu}{}_{;\mu}\sqrt{-g}\textrm{d}^{n}x=\oint_{\partial V}\sqrt{-h}A^{\mu}\textrm{d}^{n-1}S_{\mu},\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 is the partial metric on the hypersurface 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial V$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $d^{n-1}S_{\mu}$
\end_inset

 is the oriented element of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(n-1\right)$
\end_inset

-volume on the hypersurface.
 Using this formula, we may reduce volume integrals of total divergences
 to boundary integrals.
 Assuming that the contribution of the boundary terms vanishes, we obtain
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\int\textrm{d}^{n}x\sqrt{-g}A_{\,;\mu}^{\mu}B=-\int\textrm{d}^{n}x\sqrt{-g}A^{\mu}B_{,\mu}.\label{eq:modified Gauss}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 This formula can be used to integrate by parts: We set 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{\mu}\equiv\phi_{,\alpha}g^{\alpha\mu}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $B\equiv\psi$
\end_inset

, and find
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int\textrm{d}^{4}x\sqrt{-g}\phi_{,\alpha}\psi_{,\beta}g^{\alpha\beta}=-\int\textrm{d}^{4}x\sqrt{-g}\left(\phi_{,\alpha}g^{\alpha\beta}\right)_{;\beta}\psi.\]

\end_inset

 Note that the covariant derivative of the metric is zero, 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\alpha\beta}^{\,;\alpha}=0$
\end_inset

, so we may lower or raise the indices under covariant derivatives at will;
 for example,

Let us adopt the following, somewhat more abstract geometric picture of

 As usual, the tangent space

\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{G}$

\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}$

 Thus, a tangent vector

\begin_inset Formula $S_{EH}$

 We need to find the variation of

 The calculation of

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The variation of 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{EH}[g]$
\end_inset

 can be split into three terms,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\delta S_{EH}[g] & =\delta\int_{\mathcal{M}}\textrm{d}^{4}p\, R_{\mu\nu}g^{\mu\nu}\sqrt{-g}\\
 & =\int_{\mathcal{M}}\textrm{d}^{4}p\sqrt{-g}\left[g^{\mu\nu}\delta R_{\mu\nu}+R_{\mu\nu}\delta g^{\mu\nu}-\frac{1}{2}Rg_{\mu\nu}\delta g^{\mu\nu}\right].\end{align*}

\end_inset

Shortly, we shall show that the first term in parentheses above,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\int_{\mathcal{M}}\textrm{d}^{4}p\sqrt{-g}g^{\mu\nu}\delta R_{\mu\nu},\label{eq:boundary term}\end{equation}

\end_inset

vanishes (under suitable boundary conditions) because it is a total divergence.
 Thus, we shall have
\begin_inset Formula \[
\delta S_{EH}[g]=\int_{\mathcal{M}}\textrm{d}^{4}p\sqrt{-g}\left(R_{\mu\nu}-\frac{1}{2}Rg_{\mu\nu}\right)\delta g^{\mu\nu},\]

\end_inset

which is equivalent to
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\frac{\delta S_{EH}[g]}{\delta g^{\mu\nu}(p)}=R_{\mu\nu}-\frac{1}{2}Rg_{\mu\nu}.\label{eq:Einstein equ from var}\end{equation}

\end_inset

So the condition 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta S_{EH}/\delta g^{\mu\nu}=0$
\end_inset

 is equivalent to the vacuum Einstein equation\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:vacuum Einstein}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It remains to analyze the term\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:boundary term}

\end_inset

).
 We shall now use the index-free notation for clarity.
 The term of interest is
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
g^{\mu\nu}\delta R_{\mu\nu}=\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})}\delta\textrm{Ric}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}).\label{eq:Trace of Ricci}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 The Ricci tensor is a contraction of the Riemann tensor, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{Ric}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})}R(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{a},\mathbf{y},\mathbf{b}).\]

\end_inset

To determine the variation of the Riemann tensor, we need to consider the
 change in the Levi-Civita connection, 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla\rightarrow\tilde{\nabla}$
\end_inset

, under 
\begin_inset Formula $g\rightarrow\tilde{g}=g+\delta g$
\end_inset

.
 It is easy to show that the difference 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\nabla}-\nabla$
\end_inset

 between any two connections does not contain derivatives,
\begin_inset Formula \[
(\tilde{\nabla}-\nabla)\left(f\mathbf{x}\right)=f\cdot(\tilde{\nabla}-\nabla)\mathbf{x},\]

\end_inset

 and hence acts as a transformation-valued 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\Gamma$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tilde{\nabla}_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{x}-\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{x}\equiv\delta\Gamma(\mathbf{u})\mathbf{x}.\]

\end_inset

An explicit formula for 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\Gamma$
\end_inset

 can be derived (see the Calculation below) but is not required for the
 present derivation.

From this point and until the end of the section, index-free computations

The tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\Gamma$
\end_inset

 has rank 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1,2\right)$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q}_{1,2}$
\end_inset

 defined by
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\mathbf{q}_{1} & \equiv\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})}\delta\Gamma(\mathbf{x})\mathbf{y},\\
g(\mathbf{q}_{2},\mathbf{y}) & \equiv\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})}g(\mathbf{b},\delta\Gamma(\mathbf{a})\mathbf{y}),\;\textrm{for all }\mathbf{y}.\end{align*}

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q}_{1,2}$
\end_inset

 involve 
\emph on
derivatives
\emph default
 of the metric perturbation 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta g$
\end_inset

 In the index notation, we have
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\delta\Gamma\left(\mathbf{x}\right)\mathbf{y}\right)^{\mu}\equiv\delta\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\mu}x^{\alpha}y^{\beta};\quad q_{1}^{\mu}\equiv\delta\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\mu}g^{\alpha\beta},\quad q_{2}^{\mu}\equiv g^{\mu\nu}\delta\Gamma_{\alpha\nu}^{\alpha}.\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we use the properties of the trace (see Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Index-free-trace}

\end_inset

) and the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla$
\end_inset

 can be interchanged with 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 and with the

\end_inset

mute vectors
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 appearing under the trace operation.
 The first term in Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:two terms Trace}

\end_inset

) is expressed as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})}\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})}g(\mathbf{b},\delta\Gamma(\mathbf{a})\mathbf{y})=\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})}g(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{q}_{2},\mathbf{y})\equiv\textrm{div }\mathbf{q}_{2},\]

\end_inset

and the second term as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})}g & \left(\mathbf{b},\left(\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\delta\Gamma\right)(\mathbf{x})\mathbf{y}\right)=\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})}g\left(\mathbf{b},\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})}\delta\Gamma(\mathbf{x})\mathbf{y}\right)\\
= & \textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})}g\left(\mathbf{b},\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{q}_{1}\right)\equiv\textrm{div }\mathbf{q}_{1}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Hence, 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
g^{\mu\nu}\delta R_{\mu\nu}=\textrm{div}\left(\mathbf{q}_{2}-\mathbf{q}_{1}\right)\equiv\textrm{div }\mathbf{q},\label{eq:total divergence deltaq}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q}\equiv\mathbf{q}_{2}-\mathbf{q}_{1}$
\end_inset

 is an auxiliary vector field defined through 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta g^{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, the term\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:boundary term}

\end_inset

) is an integral of a total divergence and thus vanishes,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int_{\tilde{\mathcal{M}}}\textrm{d}^{4}p\sqrt{-g}g^{\mu\nu}\delta R_{\mu\nu}=\int_{\mathcal{\tilde{M}}}\textrm{d}^{4}p\sqrt{-g}\,\textrm{div}\left(\mathbf{q}\right)=0,\]

\end_inset

as long as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q}$
\end_inset

 vanishes at the boundary 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$
\end_inset

 of the domain of integration 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$
\end_inset

.
 (Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q}$
\end_inset

 depends on the derivatives of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta g^{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

, this condition is satisfied if 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta g^{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 identically vanishes outside the domain 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$

\begin_inset Formula $\delta g^{\mu\nu}$

\begin_inset Formula $\delta g_{;\alpha}^{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 vanish at the boundary of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$
\end_inset

.
 The Einstein-Hilbert action 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{EH}[g]$
\end_inset

 depends on second derivatives of the metric.
 It is a fortunate fact that the equations of motion (the Einstein equations)
 are only second-order in 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

; but, in any case, it is no surprise that the variation 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta S_{EH}[g]$
\end_inset

 contains boundary terms linear in 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla\delta g$

In the Lagrangian formulation of field theory, every field 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is described by an action functional, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int_{\mathcal{M}}\sqrt{-g}\textrm{d}^{n}p\, L[\phi],\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is an appropriate Lagrangian.
 Thus, Einstein's theory of gravity can be viewed as a field theory where
 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

field
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is the point-dependent metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}(p)$
\end_inset

 and the Lagrangian is the Einstein-Hilbert one, Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:EH action}

\end_inset

).
 If we choose a different Lagrangian, we may obtain a different theory of
 gravity.
 Many alternative theories of gravity have been considered (and most of
 them have been rejected).
 Motivated by the requirement of general covariance, one usually constrains
 the choice of gravitational Lagrangians to combinations of invariant quantities
, such as 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{\kappa\lambda\mu\nu}R^{\kappa\lambda\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\square R$
\end_inset

, etc.
 These modified theories of gravity give rise to equations with high-order
 derivatives of 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 because the Ricci scalar 
\begin_inset Formula $R[g_{\mu\nu}]$
\end_inset

 contains second derivatives of 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will consider only a relatively simple modification of the Einstein-Hilbert
 action consists of replacing the Ricci scalar 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 by a nonlinear function of 
\begin_inset Formula $R$

, so that the action is 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
S_{NL}[g]=\int_{\mathcal{M}}\sqrt{-g}\textrm{d}^{n}p\, f(R).\label{eq:nonlinear f(R) gravity action}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 (The function

Let us now derive the equation of motion for 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 from the 
\begin_inset Formula $f(R)$
\end_inset

 Lagrangian.
 We shall follow the derivation in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Einstein-Hilbert-action}

\end_inset

 with appropriate modifications, using the index notation where convenient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As before, the variation of 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{NL}[g]$
\end_inset

 can be split into three terms,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
 & \delta S_{NL}[g]=\delta\int_{\mathcal{M}}\textrm{d}^{4}p\, f\left(R_{\mu\nu}g^{\mu\nu}\right)\sqrt{-g}\\
 & =\int_{\mathcal{M}}\textrm{d}^{4}p\sqrt{-g}\left[f'(R)\left(g^{\mu\nu}\delta R_{\mu\nu}+R_{\mu\nu}\delta g^{\mu\nu}\right)-\frac{f(R)}{2}g_{\mu\nu}\delta g^{\mu\nu}\right].\end{align*}

\end_inset

The term 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{\mu\nu}\delta R_{\mu\nu}=q^{\alpha}{}_{;\alpha}$
\end_inset

 is a total divergence, as shown by Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:variation Ricci}

\end_inset

), but this term is now multiplied by 
\begin_inset Formula $f'(R)$
\end_inset

 which is not a constant since, by assumption, 
\begin_inset Formula $f(R)$
\end_inset

 is nonlinear.
 Therefore the integral
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int_{\mathcal{M}}\textrm{d}^{4}p\sqrt{-g}\, f'(R)g^{\mu\nu}\delta R_{\mu\nu}=\int_{\mathcal{M}}d^{4}p\sqrt{-g}f'(R)q^{\alpha}{}_{;\alpha}\]

\end_inset

does not identically vanish any more, but instead contributes to the equation
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

.
 Integrating by parts and omitting boundary terms, we have
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int_{\mathcal{M}}\textrm{d}^{4}p\sqrt{-g}\, f'(R)q^{\alpha}{}_{;\alpha}=-\int_{\mathcal{M}}d^{4}p\sqrt{-g}\left[f'(R)\right]_{;\alpha}q^{\alpha}.\]

\end_inset

However, 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 still contains derivatives of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta g^{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

, and we now need to use Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:variation Gamma}

\end_inset

) to find 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
q^{\beta}=\delta g^{\alpha\beta}{}_{;\alpha}-g_{\mu\nu}\delta g^{\mu\nu;\beta}.\label{eq:delta q ans}\end{equation}

 Express 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{\alpha}$

 through 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta g^{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 rather than through 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta g_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we obtain
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
- & \int_{\mathcal{M}}\textrm{d}^{4}p\sqrt{-g}\left[f'(R)\right]_{;\alpha}\delta q^{\alpha}\\
 & =\int_{\mathcal{M}}\textrm{d}^{4}p\sqrt{-g}\left(\left[f'(R)\right]_{;\alpha}^{;\alpha}g_{\mu\nu}-\left[f'(R)\right]_{;\mu\nu}\right)\delta g^{\mu\nu}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Therefore, the equation of motion for 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula \[
f'(R)R_{\mu\nu}-\frac{1}{2}f(R)g_{\mu\nu}+g_{\mu\nu}\square f'(R)-\left[f'(R)\right]_{;\mu\nu}=0.\]

\end_inset

This equation has fourth-order derivatives of the metric and is quite complicate
d.
 In order to simplify this theory, the standard practice is to reduce the
 above equation to a system of second-order equations by introducing an
 auxiliary scalar field and changing the metric by a suitable conformal
 transformation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rather than guessing the necessary change of variables, one can perform
 the simplification in a systematic way by using the method of Lagrange
 multipliers.
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{Lagrange multipliers}

\end_inset

 I will first describe the application of this method to a trivial example
 borrowed from classical mechanics.
 Then I will explain the application of that method to the theory\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:nonlinear f(R) gravity action}

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In classical mechanics, the dynamics of a system may be described by the
 action
\begin_inset Formula \[
S[\mathbf{q}]=\int L(\mathbf{q},\dot{\mathbf{q}})dt,\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q}(t)$
\end_inset

 is the trajectory of the system, which we will assume to be a vector-valued
 function of time.
 If the Lagrangian 
\begin_inset Formula $L[\mathbf{q},\dot{\mathbf{q}}]$
\end_inset

 depends on first derivatives of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q}(t)$
\end_inset

 nonlinearly (which is usually the case), the equations of motion for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q}(t)$
\end_inset

 are second-order (they contain 
\begin_inset Formula $\ddot{\mathbf{q}}$
\end_inset

).
 Suppose we would like to reduce the Lagrangian to a simpler form that generates
 only first-order equations of motion.
 One way is to introduce a new independent variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}(t)$
\end_inset

 which is equal to the velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\mathbf{q}}(t)$
\end_inset

; then one expects to obtain a system of first-order equations for 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{q}(t),\mathbf{v}(t)\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 A straightforward way to replace velocities with an independent variable
 is to add a constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\mathbf{q}}-\mathbf{v}=0$
\end_inset

 to the Lagrangian with a Lagrange multiplier.
 Since we have a vector-valued constraint at every moment of time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, the Lagrange multiplier must also be vector-valued function of time.
 Let us denote this vector-valued Lagrange multiplier by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}(t)$
\end_inset

.
 Thus the modified action can be written as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\tilde{S}[\mathbf{q},\mathbf{v},\mathbf{s}]=\int\left[L(\mathbf{q},\mathbf{v})+\mathbf{s}\cdot\left(\dot{\mathbf{q}}-\mathbf{v}\right)\right]dt.\label{eq:action q v s}\end{equation}

\end_inset

The variation of the new action 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{S}$
\end_inset

 with respect to three independent vector-valued functions 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q},\mathbf{v},\mathbf{s}$
\end_inset

 yields equations of motion that are equivalent to the original ones.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We note that the variables 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 enter the action\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:action q v s}

\end_inset

) as Lagrange multipliers; the action involves derivatives of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q}$
\end_inset

 but no derivatives of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
 As we suspect that two Lagrange multipliers constraining a single function
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q}$
\end_inset

 are too many, we would like to eliminate one of these Lagrange multipliers.
 To this end, let us compute the variation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{S}$
\end_inset

 with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{\delta\tilde{S}[\mathbf{q},\mathbf{v},\mathbf{s}]}{\delta\mathbf{v}(t)}=\frac{\partial L(\mathbf{q}(t),\mathbf{v}(t))}{\partial\mathbf{v}}-\mathbf{s}(t).\]

\end_inset

This is an algebraic equation that can be solved with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 (if 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is a nonlinear and nondegenerate function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

).
 Let us denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{V}(\mathbf{q},\mathbf{s})$
\end_inset

 the functions that express 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 through 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{v}=\mathbf{V}(\mathbf{q},\mathbf{s}).\]

\end_inset

Since the action\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:action q v s}

\end_inset

) contains 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 merely as a Lagrange multiplier (no derivatives of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 are involved), we may now substitute 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}=\mathbf{V}(\mathbf{q},\mathbf{s})$
\end_inset

 into the action\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:action q v s}

\end_inset

) and obtain an equivalent action that depends only on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tilde{S}[\mathbf{q},\mathbf{s}]=\int\left[L(\mathbf{q},\mathbf{V}(\mathbf{q},\mathbf{s}))-\mathbf{s}\cdot\mathbf{V}(\mathbf{q},\mathbf{s})+\mathbf{s}\cdot\dot{\mathbf{q}}\right]dt.\]

\end_inset

 This action is linear in time derivatives, and hence the equations of motion
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q}(t),\mathbf{s}(t)$
\end_inset

 are first-order in the time derivatives.
 One may recognize this as the Hamiltonian action, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}$
\end_inset

 is the canonical momentum corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q}$
\end_inset

, and
\begin_inset Formula \[
L-\mathbf{s}\cdot\mathbf{V}(\mathbf{s},\mathbf{q})\equiv H(\mathbf{s},\mathbf{q})\]

\end_inset

 is the Hamiltonian.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Remark:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we have seen, the Lagrange multiplier 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}$
\end_inset

 has the significance of the canonical momentum.
 Usually, the canonical momentum corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q}$
\end_inset

 would be denoted by the letter 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{p}$
\end_inset

.
 In the present derivation, I chose a different letter, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}$
\end_inset

, because I wanted to emphasize that we do not know the significance of
 the new variables in advance.
 It will not be always the case that the new variables introduced through
 the Lagrange multiplier method have the significance of canonical momenta.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The method of Lagrange multipliers is more general than the familiar passage
 from the Lagrangian to the Hamiltonian description.
 For instance, one could treat Lagrangians containing higher derivatives
 in the same systematic manner.
 One could also replace only 
\emph on
some
\emph default
 of the higher derivatives but not all, if this proves to be convenient
 in a particular situation.

Let us now apply the method of Lagrange multipliers to the action\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:nonlinear f(R) gravity action}

\end_inset

).
 At this point, we do not have the purpose of reducing the system to first-order
 equations, but rather to remove the nonlinearity in the 
\begin_inset Formula $f(R)$
\end_inset

 term.
 Therefore, we are motivated to introduce a new field 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 equal to the Ricci scalar 
\begin_inset Formula $R[g_{\mu\nu}]$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, an action equivalent to the action\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\int_{\mathcal{M}}\sqrt{-g}\textrm{d}^{n}p\left[f(r)+\left(R[g_{\mu\nu}]-r\right)\lambda\right],\label{eq:f(R) action 1}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is a Lagrange multiplier field.
 Variation of the above action with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 yields the algebraic equation
\begin_inset Formula \[
f'(r)=\lambda,\]

\end_inset

which can be solved to express 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 through 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 (since by assumption 
\begin_inset Formula $f^{\prime\prime}(r)\neq0$
\end_inset

).
 Let us denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $r(\lambda)$
\end_inset

 the function obtained by solving the algebraic equation 
\begin_inset Formula $f'(r)=\lambda$
\end_inset

.
 We can then substitute 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 into the action\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:f(R) action 1}

\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
S[g_{\mu\nu},\lambda]=\int_{\mathcal{M}}\sqrt{-g}\textrm{d}^{n}p\left[f(r(\lambda))-r(\lambda)\lambda+\lambda R[g_{\mu\nu}]\right],\label{eq:f(R) action 2}\end{equation}

\end_inset

which now depends only on the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 and the new field 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

.
 Note that the field 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 must be varied independently of 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

; the constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $R[g_{\mu\nu}]=r(\lambda)$
\end_inset

 will be a consequence of the equations of motion.

linearly
\emph default
 on 
\begin_inset Formula $R$

 Namely, we perform a suitable conformal transformation of the metric.
 According to Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:R Rtilde}

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $N=4$

\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}\rightarrow\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 with a conformal factor 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{2\Omega}\neq0$
\end_inset

 will change the variables as follows,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
g_{\mu\nu} & =e^{2\Omega}\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu},\quad\sqrt{-g}=e^{4\Omega}\sqrt{-\tilde{g}},\\
R[g_{\mu\nu}] & =e^{-2\Omega}\left(R[\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}]+6\tilde{\square}\Omega+6\tilde{g}^{\mu\nu}\Omega_{,\mu}\Omega_{,\nu}\right),\end{align*}

\end_inset

where the D'Alembert operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\square}$
\end_inset

 is defined with respect to the new metric 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

.
 We can now express the action\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:f(R) action 2}

\end_inset

) through the new metric.
 An appropriate choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

, namely
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\Omega=-\frac{1}{2}\ln\lambda,\quad e^{2\Omega}=\frac{1}{\lambda},\label{eq:f(R) Omega lambda}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 cancels the factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 in the action\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:f(R) action 2}

\end_inset

).
 The action in the new variables is
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
S[g_{\mu\nu},\lambda] & \equiv\tilde{S}[\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu},\Omega]=\int_{\mathcal{M}}\sqrt{-\tilde{g}}\textrm{d}^{n}p\left[\frac{f(r(\lambda))-r(\lambda)\lambda}{\lambda^{2}}\right.\nonumber \\
 & \left.+R[\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}]+6\tilde{\square}\Omega+6\tilde{g}^{\mu\nu}\Omega_{,\mu}\Omega_{,\nu}\right].\label{eq:f(R) action 3}\end{align}

\end_inset

The term 
\begin_inset Formula $6\tilde{\square}\Omega$
\end_inset

 is a total covariant derivative and can be omitted from the action.
 Also, we may express 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 through 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 using Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:f(R) Omega lambda}

\end_inset

) and regard 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 as a new scalar field.
 Introducing the auxiliary function
\begin_inset Formula \[
V(\Omega)\equiv\left.\frac{r(\lambda)\lambda-f(r(\lambda))}{\lambda^{2}}\right|_{\lambda=\lambda(\Omega)},\]

\end_inset

we rewrite the action\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:f(R) action 3}

) as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tilde{S}[\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu},\Omega]=\int_{\mathcal{M}}\sqrt{-\tilde{g}}\textrm{d}^{n}p\left[R[\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}]+6\tilde{g}^{\mu\nu}\Omega_{,\mu}\Omega_{,\nu}-V(\Omega)\right].\]

\end_inset

This is the action of usual, unmodified Einstein gravity, minimally coupled
 to a scalar field 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

 with a self-interaction potential 
\begin_inset Formula $V(\Omega)$
\end_inset

 The form of the potential 
\begin_inset Formula $V(\Omega)$
\end_inset

 is ultimately determined by the function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(R)$
\end_inset

 in the original action\InsetSpace ~

\begin_layout Standard
The form of the above equation suggests that 
\begin_inset Formula $f'(R)$
\end_inset

 is a good choice for a new field, so let us define a new scalar field 
\begin_inset Formula $p\equiv f'(R)$
\end_inset

.
 We shall assume that the function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(R)$
\end_inset

 is such that the equation 
\begin_inset Formula $p=f'(R)$
\end_inset

 can be solved for 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 (this is the usual assumption for a Legendre transformation, 
\begin_inset Formula $f^{\prime\prime}(R)\neq0$
\end_inset

).
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $R=r(p)$
\end_inset

 be the solution of the equation 
\begin_inset Formula $p=f'(R)$
\end_inset

.
 Then we obtain the system of second-order equations for 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
R_{\mu\nu}-\frac{1}{2}\frac{f(r(p))}{p}g_{\mu\nu}+g_{\mu\nu}p^{-1}\square p-p^{-1}p_{;\mu\nu} & =0,\\
R & =r(p).\end{align*}

\end_inset

The appearance of terms 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{\mu\nu}-p^{-1}p_{;\mu\nu}+g_{\mu\nu}p^{-1}\square p$
\end_inset

 suggests to perform a conformal transformation,
\begin_inset Formula \[
g_{\mu\nu}\rightarrow\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}\equiv pg_{\mu\nu},\]

\end_inset

after which these terms will be partially cancelled by the Ricci tensor
 of the conformally rescaled metric [cf.\InsetSpace ~
Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:R Rtilde}

\end_inset

)].
 It also appears convenient to replace 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln p$
\end_inset

.
 The customary change of variables is
\begin_inset Formula \[
\phi\equiv\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}\ln p,\]

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\phi$

 After a considerable amount of algebra, one can show that the equations

 Thus the nonlinear

 However, the metric

 So one needs to perform the conformal transformation back to the Jordan

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a field theory that contains some matter fields 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{j}$
\end_inset

 interacting with gravity.
 In the Lagrangian formulation, the total system is described by an action
 of the form
\begin_inset Formula \[
S[\phi_{j};g_{\mu\nu}]=\int_{\mathcal{M}}\left(L_{EH}[g]+L[\phi_{j};g_{\mu\nu}]\right)\sqrt{-g}\textrm{d}^{4}x,\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $L[\phi_{j};g_{\mu\nu}]$
\end_inset

 is a Lagrangian for the matter fields and their interactions among themselves,
 while
\begin_inset Formula \[
L_{EH}[g]\equiv\frac{1}{16\pi G}R\]

\end_inset

is the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian for gravity.
 The Euler-Lagrange equation for a matter field 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{j}$
\end_inset

 is then
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{\delta L[\phi;g_{\mu\nu}]}{\delta\phi_{j}}=0,\]

\end_inset

while the equation for the gravitational field is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{\delta L_{EH}[g]}{\delta g^{\alpha\beta}}+\frac{\delta L[\phi_{j};g_{\mu\nu}]}{\delta g^{\alpha\beta}}=0.\]

\end_inset

We have already computed 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta L_{EH}/\delta g^{\alpha\beta}$
\end_inset

, and so we can rewrite this equation as the 
\series bold

,
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{Einstein equation}

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula \[
R_{\alpha\beta}-\frac{1}{2}Rg_{\alpha\beta}=16\pi G\frac{\delta L[\phi_{j};g_{\mu\nu}]}{\delta g^{\alpha\beta}}\equiv-8\pi GT_{\alpha\beta},\]

\end_inset

where we have defined the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\alpha\beta}$
\end_inset

 called the

 (EMT) of matter,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
T_{\alpha\beta}\equiv\frac{2}{\sqrt{-g}}\frac{\delta L[\phi_{j};g_{\mu\nu}]}{\delta g^{\alpha\beta}}.\label{eq:metric EMT}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 This tensor plays the role of a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

source
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for the gravitational field.
 In most field theories, this tensor also describes the distribution of
 local energy and momentum density of the field, defined in the conventional
 sense.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, a minimally coupled scalar field with the Lagrangian\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
T_{\alpha\beta}=\phi_{,\alpha}\phi_{,\beta}-\frac{1}{2}g_{\alpha\beta}\phi_{,\mu}\phi^{,\mu}+V(\phi)g_{\alpha\beta}.\label{eq:scalar field EMT}\end{equation}

\end_inset

The electromagnetic field is described by the Maxwell tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

, which satisfies the Maxwell equations.
 These equations can be derived from the Lagrangian
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
L_{EM}[F;g]=-\frac{\sqrt{-g}}{16\pi}F_{\alpha\beta}F^{\alpha\beta}=-\frac{\sqrt{-g}}{16\pi}F_{\alpha\beta}F_{\mu\nu}g^{\alpha\mu}g^{\beta\nu},\label{eq:Maxwell Lagrangian}\end{equation}

\end_inset

from which also follows the EMT
\begin_inset Formula \[
T_{\mu\nu}=\frac{1}{4\pi}\left(\frac{1}{4}g_{\mu\nu}F_{\alpha\beta}F^{\alpha\beta}-F_{\alpha\mu}F_{\beta\nu}g^{\alpha\beta}\right).\]

 If a Lagrangian is of the form

 then 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{2}{\sqrt{-g}}\frac{\delta L}{\delta g^{\alpha\beta}}=-Lg_{\alpha\beta}+2\frac{\delta L}{\delta g^{\alpha\beta}}.\]

\end_inset

In the scalar field Lagrangian, the only term that depends on 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}g^{\mu\nu}\phi_{,\mu}\phi_{,\nu}$
\end_inset

 Hence,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\frac{\delta L[g,\phi]}{\delta g^{\alpha\beta}} & =\frac{1}{2}\phi_{,\alpha}\phi_{,\beta},\\
T_{\alpha\beta} & =\phi_{,\alpha}\phi_{,\beta}-g_{\alpha\beta}L\end{align*}

\end_inset

as required.
 The same procedure for the Lagrangian 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{EM}$
\end_inset

 yields the required answer since
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{\delta L}{\delta g^{\mu\nu}}=-\frac{1}{16\pi}\left(F_{\alpha\mu}F_{\beta\nu}g^{\alpha\beta}+F_{\mu\alpha}F_{\nu\beta}g^{\alpha\beta}\right)=-\frac{g^{\alpha\beta}}{8\pi}F_{\alpha\mu}F_{\beta\nu}.\]

General covariance

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a field theory where every matter field 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{i}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,...,N$
\end_inset

, is coupled to gravity through the metric tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 and the covariant derivatives 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla$
\end_inset

 Such a field theory is invariant under general coordinate transformations;
 this property is called the

 of the theory.
 General coordinate transformations can be parametrized by four functions
 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

.
 According to the Noether theorem, the invariance with respect to gauge
 transformations leads to mathematical identities that hold regardless of
 the equations of motion.
 However, we 
\emph on
can
\emph default
 obtain useful conservation laws out of a gauge symmetry if we 
\emph on

\emph default
 use the equations of motion.
 We shall now show that the requirement of general covariance for a set
 of fields 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{i}$
\end_inset

 with a Lagrangian 
\begin_inset Formula $L[\phi_{i};g]$
\end_inset

, together with the Euler-Lagrange equation of motion,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\frac{\delta L}{\delta\phi_{i}(x)}=0,\label{eq:phi equ Sm}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 yields a conservation law for the field's energy-momentum tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 defined by Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:metric EMT}

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To derive the conservation law, we consider an infinitesimal coordinate
 transformation
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{x}\rightarrow\tilde{\mathbf{x}}=\mathbf{x}+\varepsilon\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}),\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}$
\end_inset

 is a vector field, which is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

generator
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the transformation (points are shifted along the orbits of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}$
\end_inset

).
 The matter fields 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{i}$
\end_inset

 are transformed by the flow of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}$
\end_inset

 according to
\begin_inset Formula \[
\phi_{i}(\mathbf{x})\rightarrow\tilde{\phi}_{i}(\mathbf{x})=\phi_{i}(\tilde{\mathbf{x}})+\delta q_{i}(\tilde{\mathbf{x}}),\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta q_{i}(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 is defined appropriately for each field, such that the local variation
 of the field 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{i}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\phi_{i}=\varepsilon\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{f}}\phi_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 For instance, the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{\alpha\beta}$
\end_inset

 is transformed as
\begin_inset Formula \[
g^{\alpha\beta}(\mathbf{x})\rightarrow\tilde{g}^{\alpha\beta}(\mathbf{x})=g^{\alpha\beta}(\mathbf{x})+\varepsilon\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{f}}g^{\alpha\beta}(\mathbf{x})=g^{\alpha\beta}+\varepsilon\left(f^{\alpha;\beta}+f^{\beta;\alpha}\right).\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We know that the action is invariant under the transformation, therefore
 the variation 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\int Ld^{4}x$
\end_inset

 must vanish:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
0 & =\delta\int Ld^{4}x=\int\left[\frac{\delta L}{\delta g^{\alpha\beta}(\mathbf{x})}\delta g^{\alpha\beta}(\mathbf{x})+\frac{\delta L}{\delta\phi_{i}(\mathbf{x})}\delta\phi_{i}(\mathbf{x})\right]\textrm{d}^{4}x\nonumber \\
 & =\int\frac{\delta L}{\delta g^{\alpha\beta}(\mathbf{x})}\varepsilon\left(f^{\alpha;\beta}+f^{\beta;\alpha}\right)\textrm{d}^{4}x+\int\frac{\delta L}{\delta\phi_{i}(\mathbf{x})}\delta\phi_{i}(\mathbf{x})\textrm{d}^{4}x.\label{eq:ds var xi}\end{align}

\end_inset

 Since the fields 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{i}$
\end_inset

 satisfy Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:phi equ Sm}

\end_inset

), the second term vanishes.
 Expressing the first term through the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\alpha\beta}$
\end_inset

, we get
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
\int T_{\alpha\beta}f^{\beta;\alpha}\sqrt{-g}\textrm{d}^{4}x & =\int\left[\left(T_{\alpha\beta}f^{\beta}\right)^{;\alpha}-T_{\alpha\beta}^{\,;\alpha}f^{\beta}\right]\sqrt{-g}\textrm{d}^{4}x\nonumber \\
 & =-\int T_{\alpha\beta}^{\,;\alpha}f^{\beta}\sqrt{-g}\textrm{d}^{4}x=0.\label{eq:Tab xi}\end{align}

\end_inset

Here we assumed that 
\begin_inset Formula $f^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 vanishes at infinity sufficiently quickly.
 Since Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Tab xi}

\end_inset

) must be satisfied for arbitrary 
\begin_inset Formula $f^{\alpha}(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

, we conclude that the conservation law 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\alpha\beta}^{\,;\alpha}=0$
\end_inset

 holds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Remark:

\begin_layout Standard
The absence of the covariant volume factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{-g}$
\end_inset

 in Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:ds var xi}

\end_inset

) is not a mistake; the result is nevertheless a covariant quantity.
 The derivative with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $f^{\alpha}$
\end_inset

 is calculated using the chain rule, e.g.
\begin_inset Formula \[
\delta\int L\textrm{d}^{4}x=\int\left[\frac{\delta L}{\delta g^{\alpha\beta}(\mathbf{x})}\delta g^{\alpha\beta}(\mathbf{x})+\frac{\delta L}{\delta\phi_{i}}\delta\phi_{i}(\mathbf{x})\right]\textrm{d}^{4}x,\]

\end_inset

and the rule requires a simple integration over 
\begin_inset Formula $d^{4}x$
\end_inset

.
 The correct covariant behavior is supplied by the Lagrangian 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 that itself contains a factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{-g}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a flat spacetime, the laws of energy and momentum conservation follow
 from the invariance of the action under spacetime translations.
 In the presence of gravitation the spacetime is curved, so in general the
 spacetime translations are not a physical symmetry any more.
 However, the action is covariant with respect to arbitrary coordinate transform
ations.
 The corresponding conservation law is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

covariant conservation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the EMT, 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\alpha\beta}^{\,;\alpha}=0$
\end_inset

.
 However, this law does not actually express the conservation of energy
 or momentum of the matter field 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{i}$
\end_inset

 because of the presence of the covariant derivative.
 That equation would be a conservation law if it had the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{\mu}\left(\sqrt{-g}T^{\mu\nu}\right)=0$
\end_inset

, but instead it can be shown that
\begin_inset Formula \[
\partial_{\mu}\left(\sqrt{-g}T^{\mu\nu}\right)=-\sqrt{-g}\Gamma_{\mu\lambda}^{\nu}T^{\mu\lambda}\neq0,\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{\mu\lambda}^{\nu}$
\end_inset

 is the Christoffel symbol.
 The energy of the matter fields alone, described by the energy-momentum
 tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\alpha\beta}$
\end_inset

, is not necessarily conserved; the gravitational field can change the energy
 and the momentum of matter.

\begin_inset Formula $g^{\mu\nu}\phi_{;\mu\nu}+V'(\phi)=0$

\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}

\end_inset

In a theory of a single scalar field 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 coupled to gravity, the conservation law 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\mu\nu}{}^{;\mu}=0$
\end_inset

 is essentially a consequence of the Einstein equation.
 Therefore, one may say that the Einstein equation contains the equation
 of motion for the scalar field.
 However, the same statement will not hold for theories with more than one
 scalar field.
 A single conservation law cannot yield several independent equations of
 motion for all the fields.

\begin_layout Standard
A field theory is described by a Lagragian, and a

 For example, consider the theory of a scalar field with the Lagrangian
 
\begin_inset Formula $L[\phi]$

(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Lagr scalar}

\begin_inset Formula $g=\eta=\textrm{diag}(1,-1,-1,-1)$

 Since this Lagrangian in this spacetime does not depend explicitly on the
 coordinates, it is invariant under a translation of fields, 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(\mathbf{x})\rightarrow\phi(\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{a})$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$

 We shall now study the consequences of this symmetry for any Lagrangian
 
\begin_inset Formula $L[\phi]$

\begin_inset Formula $\phi$

\begin_inset Formula $\nabla\phi$

\begin_layout Standard
Let us first examine the transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(\mathbf{x})\rightarrow\phi(\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{a})$

 in more detail.
 The transformation is understood as the replacement of the function

 by a different function 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\phi}(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula \[

 at a location 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$

\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 at the location 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

; i.e.\InsetSpace ~
the value of the function is not modified beyond the necessary change
 due to the replacement of the argument, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\rightarrow\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Lagrangian 
\begin_inset Formula $L[\tilde{\phi}]$
\end_inset

 is invariant under the replacement 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\rightarrow\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 in the following sense: the 
\emph on
value
\emph default
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $L[\tilde{\phi}](\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

, computed at a fixed location 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$

\emph on

\emph default

\begin_inset Formula $L[\phi](\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{a})$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $L[\phi]$
\end_inset

, computed for the old field 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

, at the location 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

.
 Let us now express this invariance as a mathematical identity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is convenient to consider an infinitesimal displacement 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

.
 At a given location 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

, the value of any scalar function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\mathbf{x)}$
\end_inset

 changes under 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\rightarrow\mathbf{x}+\delta\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

, to first order, as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\delta f(\mathbf{x})\equiv\tilde{f}(\mathbf{x})-f(\mathbf{x})=f(\mathbf{x}+\delta\mathbf{a})-f(\mathbf{x})=\nabla_{\delta\mathbf{a}}f+O(\delta\mathbf{a}^{2}).\]

\end_inset

This is the 
\series bold
local variation
\series default
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{local variation}

\end_inset

of the value of the function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

.
 (From now on, we shall drop the terms 
\begin_inset Formula $O(\delta\mathbf{a}^{2})$
\end_inset

 since we need to consider only first-order variations.) Because of the assumptio
n of translational invariance, the same argument applies also to the Lagrangian
 
\begin_inset Formula $L[\phi](\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

, considered as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\delta L[\phi(\mathbf{x})] & \equiv L[\tilde{\phi}(\mathbf{x})]-L[\phi(\mathbf{x})]\\
 & =L[\phi](\mathbf{x}+\delta\mathbf{a})-L[\phi](\mathbf{x})=\nabla_{\delta\mathbf{a}}L[\phi](\mathbf{x}).\end{align*}

\end_inset

The above relation is, essentially, the requirement of translational invariance
 of the Lagrangian 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

.
 On the other hand, the same variation 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta L$
\end_inset

 can be computed directly, expressing it through the local variation of
 the field,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\delta\phi(\mathbf{x})\equiv\tilde{\phi}(\mathbf{x})-\phi(\mathbf{x})=\nabla_{\delta\mathbf{a}}\phi(\mathbf{x}).\]

\end_inset

We have
\begin_inset Formula \[
\delta L[\phi(\mathbf{x})]=\frac{\partial L}{\partial\phi}\delta\phi+\frac{\partial L}{\partial\phi_{,\mu}}\delta\phi_{,\mu}.\]

\end_inset

Thus the same quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta L$
\end_inset

 can be expressed in two different ways:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\delta L[\phi(\mathbf{x})]=\frac{\partial L}{\partial\phi}\delta\phi+\frac{\partial L}{\partial\phi_{,\mu}}\delta\phi_{,\mu}=\nabla_{\delta\mathbf{a}}L.\]

\end_inset

This identity expresses the invariance of the Lagrangian 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 under translations.
 A conservation law can be now derived, assuming that the Euler-Lagrange
 equation holds for a specific field configuration 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{\partial L[\phi]}{\partial\phi}-\nabla_{\mu}\frac{\partial L[\phi]}{\partial\phi_{,\mu}}=0.\]

\end_inset

Namely, since 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 is a constant vector, we can express 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\phi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta L$

 as total divergences, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\delta\phi=\nabla_{\delta\mathbf{a}}\phi=\phi_{,\mu}\delta a^{\mu}=\nabla_{\mu}\left(\phi\delta a^{\mu}\right),\quad\nabla_{\delta\mathbf{a}}L=\nabla_{\mu}\left(L\delta a^{\mu}\right),\]

\end_inset

and then rewrite the above identity as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
0 & =\frac{\partial L}{\partial\phi}\delta\phi+\frac{\partial L}{\partial\phi_{,\mu}}\delta\phi_{,\mu}-\nabla_{\delta\mathbf{a}}L\\
 & =\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial\phi}-\nabla_{\mu}\frac{\partial L}{\partial\phi_{,\mu}}\right)\delta\phi+\nabla_{\mu}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial\phi_{,\mu}}\phi_{,\nu}-L\delta_{\nu}^{\mu}\right)\delta a^{\nu}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Since the Euler-Lagrange equation is assumed to hold and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 is arbitrary, it follows that the following conservation law holds,
\begin_inset Formula \[
0=\nabla_{\mu}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial\phi_{,\mu}}\phi_{,\nu}-Lg_{\mu\nu}\right)\equiv\nabla_{\mu}T_{\nu}^{\mu},\]

The local variation of the Lagrangian (at fixed

where we have used the Euler-Lagrange equation.
 On the other hand, the invariance of the action under the transformation
 means that

\end_inset

we obtain the identity (up to terms of order

\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}

 Indeed, we can always add a divergence of an arbitrary antisymmetric tensor

\begin_inset Formula $\delta\phi(\phi,\alpha)$
\end_inset

 depends only on 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 and the first derivatives 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{,\mu}$
\end_inset

, so that
\begin_inset Formula \[
\delta\phi(\phi,\alpha)=p(\phi)\alpha+q^{\mu}(\phi)\alpha_{,\mu},\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\phi)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{\mu}(\phi)$
\end_inset

 are some known coefficients.
 Then the local variation of the Lagrangian is
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
0 & =\delta L[\phi(\mathbf{x}),\mathbf{x}]=\frac{\partial L}{\partial\phi}\delta\phi+\frac{\partial L}{\partial\phi_{,\mu}}\delta\phi_{,\mu}\\
 & =\frac{\partial L}{\partial\phi}p\alpha+\frac{\partial L}{\partial\phi}q^{\mu}\alpha_{,\mu}+\frac{\partial L}{\partial\phi_{,\mu}}\left(p\alpha\right)_{,\mu}+\frac{\partial L}{\partial\phi_{,\mu}}\left(q^{\nu}\alpha_{,\nu}\right)_{,\mu}\\
 & =\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial\phi}p+\frac{\partial L}{\partial\phi_{,\mu}}p_{,\mu}\right)\alpha+\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial\phi}q^{\mu}+\frac{\partial L}{\partial\phi_{,\nu}}\left(p\delta_{\nu}^{\mu}+q^{\mu}{}_{,\nu}\right)\right)\alpha_{,\mu}\\
 & \;+\frac{\partial L}{\partial\phi_{,\mu}}q^{\nu}\alpha_{,\mu\nu}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 is an arbitrary function, the terms involving 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla\alpha$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla\nabla\alpha$
\end_inset

, etc., must separately vanish.
 Thus we obtain the following three identities,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\frac{\partial L}{\partial\phi}p+\frac{\partial L}{\partial\phi_{,\mu}}p_{,\mu} & =0,\\
\frac{\partial L}{\partial\phi}q^{\mu}+\frac{\partial L}{\partial\phi_{,\nu}}\left(p\delta_{\nu}^{\mu}+q^{\mu}{}_{,\nu}\right) & =0,\\
\frac{\partial L}{\partial\phi_{,\mu}}q^{\nu}+\frac{\partial L}{\partial\phi_{,\nu}}q^{\mu} & =0.\end{align*}

\end_inset

(The last line follows because 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{,\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 is an arbitrary 
\emph on
symmetric
\emph default
 tensor.) Note that we did not assume that the field 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 satisfies the Euler-Lagrange equation.
 Hence, the above identities hold simply because of the mathematical properties
 of the Lagrangian and the fields.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As an illustration, let us evaluate the three identities in the Maxwell
 theory.
 The field 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is now the 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{\mu}$
\end_inset

, and we have
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\frac{\partial L_{EM}}{\partial A_{\mu}} & =0,\quad\frac{\partial L_{EM}}{\partial A_{\mu,\nu}}=-\frac{1}{4\pi}F^{\mu\nu},\\
\delta A_{\mu} & =\alpha_{,\mu}=\delta_{\mu}^{\nu}\alpha_{,\nu}\equiv q_{\mu}^{\nu}\alpha_{,\nu};\quad q_{\mu;\rho}^{\nu}=0;\quad p=0.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Of the three identities, the first two yield 
\begin_inset Formula $0=0$
\end_inset

 and the last one is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{\partial L}{\partial A_{\lambda,\mu}}q_{\lambda}^{\nu}+\frac{\partial L}{\partial A_{\lambda,\nu}}q_{\lambda}^{\mu}=F^{\nu\mu}+F^{\mu\nu}=0.\]

\end_inset

This is a simple mathematical consequence of the definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $F^{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The invariance of a field theory under gauge transformations 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi\rightarrow\tilde{\phi}(\phi;\alpha)$
\end_inset

 does not lead to useful conservation laws but has another important consequence
 for the theory.
 Consider a Cauchy problem for the field 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

, which consists of specifying the initial values of the field 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{in}(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 at an initial spacelike 3-surface 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

.
 Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 is a solution of the Euler-Lagrange equation for the initial data 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{\text{in}}$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

.
 The transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi\rightarrow\tilde{\phi}$
\end_inset

 is a symmetry of the equations of motion, so 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\phi}(\phi;\alpha)$
\end_inset

 is another solution, for an arbitrary function 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

.
 The function 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 can be chosen so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=0$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 but 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\neq0$
\end_inset

 to the future of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

.
 The solution 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\phi}(\phi(\mathbf{x});\alpha)$
\end_inset

 will then have the same initial data 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{\text{in}}$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 but will differ from 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 to the future of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, the solution of the Cauchy problem is not unique.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In fact, this lack of uniqueness was a problem initially encountered by
 A.
 Einstein who came up with the following 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hole argument
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{hole argument}

\end_inset

 when trying to derive the equations for the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

.
 Suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 is a solution for the metric in the spacetime, subject to some boundary
 conditions.
 If the boundary conditions are imposed on some 3-surface 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 that encircles a domain of spacetime, we can find a small region (a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hole
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) inside the domain.
 Due to the general covariance of the theory, we are free to transform the
 coordinates, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\rightarrow\tilde{\mathbf{x}}$
\end_inset

, in such a way that the coordinates are changed only within the hole but
 remain the same everywhere else.
 This would change the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 inside the hole but not elsewhere.
 The new metric 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{g}$
\end_inset

 still satisfies the same boundary conditions as 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{g}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, the metric at any given point 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 is not uniquely specified by the equations of motion and boundary conditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The resolution of this paradox is that coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 are arbitrary labels assigned to events in spacetime.
 A gauge transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\rightarrow\tilde{\mathbf{x}}$
\end_inset

 merely relabels the events but does not influence the observable effects
 of gravitation (e.g.\InsetSpace ~
the distance between some physical events).
 Thus, solutions 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{g}$
\end_inset

 are 
\emph on
physically equivalent
\emph default
.
 In any theory with a gauge symmetry, two solutions that differ by a gauge
 transformation are physically equivalent.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, the freedom to choose an arbitrary function 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 in a gauge transformation means that any one of the fields 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{j}$
\end_inset

 may be set to zero (or to any other function).
 This will reduce the number of unknown functions to solve for.
 Such a reduction is called 
\series bold
gauge fixing
\series default
.
 For example, the gauge symmetry 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{\mu}\rightarrow A_{\mu}+\partial_{\mu}\alpha$
\end_inset

 in electrodynamics allows one to fix 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{0}=0$
\end_inset

 and to consider the remaining three components 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1},A_{2},A_{3}$
\end_inset

 as the only physically relevant fields.
 However, the Maxwell equations in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1},A_{2},A_{3}$
\end_inset

 appear much less symmetric and more difficult to solve.
 Alternatively, one may choose the 
\series bold

\series default
condition 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{\mu}{}^{;\mu}=0$
\end_inset

, or other suitable condition.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To conclude: The presence of a gauge symmetry indicates that the description
 of the theory contains 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

too many
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 fields.
 The freedom can be eliminated by fixing the gauge.
 However, a description in a fixed gauge may be much less convenient than
 the original description.

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of this section is to introduce the Hamiltonian formulation
 of general relativity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The starting point of a classical theory is the Lagrangian 
\begin_inset Formula $L(q_{i},\dot{q}_{i})$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}(t)$

\begin_inset Formula $i=1,...,N_{q}$
\end_inset

, are the generalized coordinates, and the action functional is
\begin_inset Formula \[
S[q_{i}(t)]=\int L(q_{i},\dot{q}_{i})\textrm{d}t.\]

\end_inset

 A Hamiltonian formulation of the theory is then obtained through the following
 steps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_inset Formula $\dot{q}_{i}$
\end_inset

 are expressed as functions of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$

 in the right-hand side.
\end_layout

\begin_inset Formula \[

\end_inset

These equations can be also considered as Euler-Lagrange equations following
 from the Hamiltonian action principle,
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{Hamiltonian action principle}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\delta\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\textrm{d}t\left(\sum_{i}p_{i}\dot{q}_{i}-H(p,q)\right)=0,\label{eq:Hamiltonian action}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}(t)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}(t)$
\end_inset

 are varied 
\emph on
independently
\emph default
, subject only to the boundary conditions 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta q_{i}(t_{1,2})=0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In field theory, the role of the generalized coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}(t)$
\end_inset

 is played by the fields 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{j}(t,x,y,z)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $j=1,...,N_{\phi}$
\end_inset

.
 The index 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}$
\end_inset

 now becomes a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Formula $i\equiv\{ j,x,y,z\}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{j}(t,x,y,z)$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, in the Hamiltonian formalism the dependence on time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 must be separated from the dependence on spatial coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $(x,y,z)\equiv x_{a}$
\end_inset

.
 (We shall use Latin indices for three-dimensional components.) In a curved
 spacetime, there is no natural time variable, which means that we need
 to 
\emph on
arbitrarily select
\emph default
 a coordinate 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and the corresponding family of spacelike 3-surfaces 
\begin_inset Formula $t=\textrm{const}$
\end_inset

.
 Such a family of nonintersecting spacelike 3-surfaces, covering the entire
 spacetime, is called a 
\series bold
time foliation 
\series default

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{time foliation}

of the spacetime.
 The traditional Hamiltonian approach is 
\emph on
noncovariant
\emph default
: it requires an explicit time foliation of the spacetime and treats the
 time dependence of every variable differently from the spacial dependence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Lagrangian 
\begin_inset Formula $L(q_{i},\dot{q}_{i})$
\end_inset

 is replaced by a Lagrangian 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}$
\end_inset

, which is an integral over a 3-surface,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{L}[\phi_{i},\dot{\phi}_{i}]=\int_{t=\textrm{const}}\textrm{d}^{3}x_{a}\, L(\phi_{i},\partial_{a}\phi_{i},\dot{\phi}_{i}),\]

\end_inset

where we separated the time derivatives 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\phi}_{i}$
\end_inset

 from the spatial derivatives 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{a}\phi_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 The Lagrangian 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}$
\end_inset

 is now a

\emph default
 and is denoted by a script letter, in distinction from the Lagrangian density
 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 which is a 
\emph on

\emph default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The canonical momentum 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}(t,x_{a})$
\end_inset

 is defined as the functional derivative of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}$
\end_inset

 with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\phi}_{i}(t,x_{a})$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
p_{i}(t,x_{a})=\frac{\delta\mathcal{L}[\phi_{i},\dot{\phi}_{i}]}{\delta\dot{\phi}_{i}(t,x_{a})}.\]

\end_inset

Finally, the summation over 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 in the definition of the Hamiltonian must be replaced by a summation over
 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 and an integration over the 3-surface,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{H}[p_{i},\phi_{i}]=\int_{t=\textrm{const}}\sum_{j}p_{j}(t,x_{a})\dot{\phi}_{j}(t,x_{a})\textrm{d}^{3}x_{a}-\mathcal{L}[\phi_{i},\dot{\phi}_{i}].\]

\begin_inset Formula \[

form, 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\mu\nu}=\rho u_{\mu}u_{\nu}-\left(p+\rho\right)g_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 In that case, the Lagrangian density 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}$

\end_layout

\end_inset

 The spacetime metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 is now considered as a known function, so only the electromagnetic potential
 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{\mu}$
\end_inset

 is to be determined.
 (To express this, one says that 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 is a

.) 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{background field}

\end_inset

To compute the canonical momenta corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{\mu}$
\end_inset

\emph on

\emph default
 derivatives of the field 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{\mu}$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose a time foliation of the spacetime is fixed and some coordinates
 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{a}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $a=1,2,3$
\end_inset

 are chosen on equal-time surfaces 
\begin_inset Formula $t=\textrm{const}$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 be a normalized, timelike vector field orthogonal to the equal-time surfaces.
 For each point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

, the subspace 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}^{\perp}(p)\subset T_{p}\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 is the tangent space to the equal-time surface intersecting the point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 Then we may decompose the vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{A}=\mathbf{n}A_{0}+P\mathbf{A},\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{0}\equiv g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{A})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{n}g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 is the orthogonal projector onto 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}^{\perp}$
\end_inset

.
 The 4-vector 
\begin_inset Formula $P\mathbf{A}$
\end_inset

 is spacelike and tangent to the equal-time surfaces.
 Hence, in local coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x_{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

 on equal-time surfaces, the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $P\mathbf{A}$
\end_inset

 is described by a 3-vector with components 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ A_{1},A_{2},A_{3}\right\} \equiv\vec{A}$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly, we can define the 3-vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{E}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{B}$
\end_inset

.
 Time derivatives appear in the electric field 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{E}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\vec{E}\equiv E_{a}=\partial_{t}A_{a}-\partial_{a}A_{0}\equiv\partial_{t}\vec{A}-\textrm{grad }A_{0},\]

\end_inset

 while the magnetic field 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\vec{B}\equiv B_{a}=\sum_{b,c=1}^{3}\varepsilon_{abc}\partial_{b}A_{c}=\textrm{rot }\vec{A}\]

\end_inset

 depends only on spatial derivatives.
 It is clear that the Lagrangian does not contain the time derivative of
 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, we cannot define a canonical momentum 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{0}$
\end_inset

, and there are no Hamilton equations of motion for the pair 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ A_{0},p_{0}\right\} $
\end_inset

; in this case, one says that 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{0}$
\end_inset

 is 
\emph on
not a dynamical variable
\emph default
.
 This conclusion agrees with the existence of a gauge symmetry in electrodynamic
s.
 Namely, by performing a gauge transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{\mu}\rightarrow A_{\mu}+\partial_{\mu}\alpha$
\end_inset

 one could set 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{0}$
\end_inset

 to an arbitrary fixed function (this is called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fixing the gauge
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 For simplicity, let us set 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{0}=0$
\end_inset

.
 Note that the variation of the Lagrangian with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{0}$
\end_inset

 gives 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\sum_{a=1}^{3}\partial_{a}\left(\sqrt{-g}E_{a}\right)\equiv\sqrt{-g}\,\textrm{div }\vec{E}=0,\label{eq:Maxwell constraint}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $a=1,2,3$

\end_inset

 are easily found,
\begin_inset Formula \[
p_{a}(x)=-\frac{\sqrt{-g}}{4\pi}E_{a}=\frac{\sqrt{-g}}{4\pi}\dot{A}_{a}.\]

\end_inset

The time derivatives 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{A}_{a}$
\end_inset

 are expressed through the momenta as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\dot{A}_{a}=\frac{4\pi}{\sqrt{-g}}p_{a},\]

\end_inset

hence the Hamiltonian is
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\mathcal{H}[p_{a},A_{a},A_{0}] & =\int_{t=\textrm{const}}d^{3}x_{a}\left(\frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{-g}}\sum_{b=1}^{3}p_{b}^{2}(x)+\frac{\sqrt{-g}}{8\pi}\left|\vec{B}\right|^{2}\right)\\
 & =\int_{t=\textrm{const}}d^{3}x_{a}\frac{\sqrt{-g}}{8\pi}\left(|\vec{E}|^{2}-|\vec{B}|^{2}\right),\end{align*}

\end_inset

which (in flat space) is the familiar expression for the total energy of
 the electromagnetic field at a fixed time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Hamilton equations of motion are
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\frac{\partial A_{a}}{\partial t} & =\frac{\delta\mathcal{H}}{\delta p_{a}}=\frac{4\pi}{\sqrt{-g}}p_{a},\\
\frac{\partial p_{a}}{\partial t} & =-\frac{\delta\mathcal{H}}{\delta A_{a}}=\sum_{b,c}\partial_{c}(\sqrt{-g}\varepsilon_{abc}B_{b})\equiv-\sqrt{-g}\,\textrm{rot }\vec{B}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

It is straightforward to see that the above equations, together with the
 constraint\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Maxwell constraint}

), are equivalent to the Maxwell equations in vacuum.
 The constraint is merely a restriction on possible initial conditions:
 Once the constraint holds at an initial time, it will hold at any future
 time since 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{t}\textrm{div }\vec{E}=-\textrm{div}\left(\textrm{rot }\vec{B}\right)=0$

\sum_{a}\partial_{a}\left(\sqrt{-g}A_{a}\right)=\textrm{div }\vec{A}=0,\]

\end_inset

 will remove the remaining gauge freedom.
 Note that the constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{div }\vec{E}=0$
\end_inset

 will be an automatic consequence of this gauge condition.
 The resulting gauge is called the 
\series bold
radiation gauge
\series default
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{radiation gauge}

\end_inset

because 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{div }\vec{E}=0$
\end_inset

 is the Maxwell equation in vacuum, describing the propagation of pure electroma
gnetic field, and 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{0}=0$
\end_inset

 means, heuristically, the absence of an electrostatic field component.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since we have fixed the gauge, we had to add the constraint\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Maxwell constraint}

\end_inset

) to the Hamilton equations of motion.
 It is possible instead to keep the nondynamical field 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{0}$
\end_inset

 in the Hamiltonian (without introducing the momentum 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$
\end_inset

).
 The constraint will then be obtained as the equation 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\mathcal{H}/\delta A_{0}=0$
\end_inset

.
 To get a better idea of the Hamiltonian treatment of constrained systems,
 in the next subsection we shall consider some simple examples from classical
 mechanics.

\begin_layout Standard
The Hamiltonian formalism involves replacing velocities 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{q}_{i}$
\end_inset

 by momenta 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

 through the relations 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}=\delta L/\delta\dot{q}_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 However, in many cases these relations cannot be solved for some 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{q}_{i}$
\end_inset

, and then the standard rule for finding the Hamiltonian cannot be used.
 For instance, the Lagrangian for electrodynamics is independent of 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{A}_{0}$
\end_inset

 and thus the relation 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}=\delta L/\delta\dot{A}_{0}$
\end_inset

 cannot be solved for 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 Another example is when 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is 
\emph on
linear
\emph default
 in, say, the velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{q}_{1}$
\end_inset

; in this case, 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta L/\delta\dot{q}_{1}$
\end_inset

 is independent of 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{q}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and again the same problem arises: namely, we cannot express 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{q}_{1}$
\end_inset

 through the momentum 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 In these cases, one can use a slightly different but equivalent approach
 to develop a Hamiltonian formulation.
 This approach is known as the 
\series bold
Faddeev-Jackiw formalism
\series default
.
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{Faddeev-Jackiw formalism}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main idea of the Faddeev-Jackiw approach is to recognize that the Hamilton
 equations of motion are first-order in time derivatives and follow, as
 Euler-Lagrange equations, from the action\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Hamiltonian action}

\end_inset

) that is 
\emph on
linear
\emph default
 in all the velocities 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{q}_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Given the Lagrangian\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Hamiltonian action}

\end_inset

), we do not attempt to introduce new canonical momenta for 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}$
\end_inset

, because we recognize that these momenta are already present in the Lagrangian
 (they are the variables 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

).
 Thus, the transition from a Lagrangian formulation to a Hamiltonian formulation
 can be seen as the replacement of a Lagrangian action 
\begin_inset Formula $L(q,\dot{q})$
\end_inset

, which is generally nonlinear in the velocities 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{q}_{i}$
\end_inset

, by 
\emph on
another Lagrangian
\emph default
, namely 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{L}\equiv\sum_{i}p_{i}\dot{q}_{i}-H(p,q)$
\end_inset

, which is 
\emph on
linear
\emph default
 in the velocities and thus yields first-order Euler-Lagrange equations
 of motion.
 The replacement 
\begin_inset Formula $L\rightarrow\tilde{L}$
\end_inset

 comes at the cost of extending the Lagrangian by introducing extra momentum
 variables 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, we need to add only as many momentum variables as needed for
 the Lagrangian to become linear in all the velocities.
 If we notice that the Lagrangian is linear in velocities, we conclude that
 all the necessary momentum variables are already introduced, and the Hamilton
 equations will be found as the ordinary Euler-Lagrange equations for an
 ordinary (Lagrangian) system.
 All these Euler-Lagrange equations will be (at most) first-order in time
 derivatives, as expected for Hamilton equations.
 After deriving these equations, one can easily determine whether constraints
 are present in the system.
 Namely, the constraints will be any equations not containing time derivatives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a first example, consider the Lagrangian
\begin_inset Formula \[
L_{0}(x,\dot{x},y,\dot{y},z,\dot{z})=\dot{x}y+\frac{1}{2}m\dot{z}^{2}-\frac{1}{2m}y^{2}-V(x,z).\]

\end_inset

This Lagrangian is linear in 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{x}$
\end_inset

, independent of 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{y}$
\end_inset

, and quadratic in 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{z}$
\end_inset

.
 We would like to obtain a Hamiltonian formulation for this system.
 Since the Lagrangian is nonlinear in 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{z}$
\end_inset

, we introduce the canonical momentum for the variable 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
p_{z}\equiv\frac{\partial L_{0}}{\partial\dot{z}}=m\dot{z},\]

\end_inset

express 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{z}=\frac{1}{m}p_{z}$
\end_inset

, and build the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

temporary Hamiltonian
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula \[
H_{0}\equiv\left.p_{z}\dot{z}-L_{0}\right|_{\dot{z}=p_{z}/m}=-\dot{x}y+\frac{1}{2m}p_{z}^{2}+\frac{1}{2m}y^{2}+V(x,z).\]

\end_inset

Now we formulate the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

temporary Hamiltonian action principle
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as the variation of the new, extended Lagrangian, 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\tilde{L}_{0}(x,\dot{x},y,z,\dot{z},p_{z}) & \equiv p_{z}\dot{z}-H_{0}\\
 & =p_{z}\dot{z}+\dot{x}y-\frac{1}{2m}p_{z}^{2}-\frac{1}{2m}y^{2}-V(x,z).\end{align*}

\end_inset

The Lagrangian 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{L}_{0}$
\end_inset

 is linear in all the velocities.
 Therefore, we do not need to introduce any more 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

momentum
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 variables; instead, we simply need to relabel some of the existing variables
 as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

momenta.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Presently, it is clear that 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 plays the role of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

momentum
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, relabeling 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{x}\equiv y$
\end_inset

, we obtain the Hamiltonian action,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tilde{L}_{0}(x,\dot{x},p_{x},z,\dot{z},p_{z})=p_{x}\dot{x}+p_{z}\dot{z}-\frac{1}{2m}\left(p_{x}^{2}+p_{z}^{2}\right)-V(x,z),\]

\end_inset

 which describes a particle of mass 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 in a two-dimensional potential 
\begin_inset Formula $V(x,z)$
\end_inset

.
 The Euler-Lagrange equations of motion are
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\dot{x}=\frac{1}{m}p_{x}, & \quad\dot{p}_{x}=-\partial V/\partial x,\\
\dot{z}=\frac{1}{m}p_{z}, & \quad\dot{p}_{z}=-\partial V/\partial z.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Clearly, there are no constraints in this model.
 We conclude that the Lagrangian 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{0}$
\end_inset

 is actually 
\emph on
not constrained
\emph default
, despite the fact that we could not introduce the momenta 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{x}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{y}$
\end_inset

 in the conventional manner.
 The reason for the difficulty was purely technical: the initial Lagrangian
 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{0}$
\end_inset

 was already 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

half-way done
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 becoming a Hamiltonian.
 However, the unusual Lagrangian 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{0}$
\end_inset

 is completely equivalent to the more conventional 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{L}_{0}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some systems, however, 
\emph on
are
\emph default
 constrained.
 As a further example, consider the Lagrangian
\begin_inset Formula \[
L_{1}(q_{1},\dot{q}_{1},q_{2},\dot{q}_{2})=\frac{1}{2}\left(\dot{q}_{1}-q_{2}\right)^{2}.\]

\end_inset

This Lagrangian is quadratic in 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{q}_{1}$
\end_inset

, so we introduce the momentum 
\begin_inset Formula \[
p_{1}\equiv\frac{\partial L_{1}}{\partial\dot{q}_{1}}=\dot{q}_{1}-q_{2},\]

\end_inset

solve for 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{q}_{1}=p_{1}+q_{2}$
\end_inset

, and obtain the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

temporary Hamiltonian
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula \[
H_{1}(q_{1},p_{1},q_{2},p_{2})=\left.p_{1}\dot{q}_{1}-L_{1}\right|_{\dot{q}_{1}=p_{1}+q_{2}}=\frac{1}{2}p_{1}^{2}+p_{1}q_{2}\]

\end_inset

and the extended Lagrangian
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tilde{L}_{1}(q_{1},\dot{q}_{1},q_{2},\dot{q}_{2},p_{1})=p_{1}\dot{q}_{1}-H_{1}=p_{1}\dot{q}_{1}-\frac{1}{2}p_{1}^{2}-p_{1}q_{2}.\]

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{L}_{1}$
\end_inset

 is linear in all the velocities, we now find the Hamilton equations as
 the Euler-Lagrange equations for 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{L}_{1}$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\dot{q}_{1}-p_{1}-q_{2}=0,\quad p_{1}=0,\quad\dot{p}_{1}=0.\]

\end_inset

Clearly, we have one constraint, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}=0$
\end_inset

, and one dynamical equation, 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{q}_{1}=q_{2}$
\end_inset

.

 In the derivation leading to Eq.\InsetSpace ~

 This yields

Substituting the definition\InsetSpace ~

 some uninteresting terms that cancel under the scalar product.

 Since the vector field

 Therefore, the metric

 way.
 The tensor

 contains the complete information needed to compute the intrinsic curvature
 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 if the full curvature 
\begin_inset Formula $^{(4)}R$

 The covariant derivative

 Therefore, the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{\Sigma}$
\end_inset

 completely characterizes the additional curvature on

\begin_layout Standard
The relation\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset Formula $^{(3)}R$
\end_inset

 vanishes if any of its arguments is parallel to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 It is possible, however, to express

\end_inset

 in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{\Sigma}$

 for tangent 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z}$

\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
^{(4)}R(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z},\mathbf{n})=\left(^{(3)}\nabla_{\mathbf{y}}K_{\Sigma}\right)\circ(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})-\left(^{(3)}\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}K_{\Sigma}\right)\circ(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z}).\label{eq:Gauss-Codazzi 2}\end{equation}

\end_inset

We can derive Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Gauss-Codazzi 2}

(

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Derivation:
\emph default
 We start from
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
^{(3)}R(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\mathbf{z} & ={}^{(4)}R(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\mathbf{z}+\left[\Gamma(\mathbf{x}),\Gamma(\mathbf{y})\right]\mathbf{z}\\
 & +(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\Gamma)(\mathbf{y})\mathbf{z}-(\nabla_{\mathbf{y}}\Gamma)(\mathbf{x})\mathbf{z}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

We write 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{\Sigma}$
\end_inset

 for brevity.
 Substituting 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma(\mathbf{x})\mathbf{y}=\mathbf{n}K(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$
\end_inset

 and using the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 is symmetric and transverse to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

, we find
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\Gamma(\mathbf{x})\Gamma(\mathbf{y})\mathbf{z} & =\mathbf{n}K(\Gamma(\mathbf{y})\mathbf{z},\mathbf{x})=\mathbf{n}K(\mathbf{n}(...),...)=0,\\
(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\Gamma)(\mathbf{y})\mathbf{z} & =(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{n})K(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z})+\mathbf{n}\left(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}K\right)\circ(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z}),\\
g((\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\Gamma)(\mathbf{y})\mathbf{z},\mathbf{n}) & =\left(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}K\right)\circ(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z}).\end{align*}

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $^{(3)}R(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z},\mathbf{n})=0$
\end_inset

, we have
\begin_inset Formula \[
^{(4)}R(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z},\mathbf{n})=\left(\nabla_{\mathbf{y}}K\right)\circ(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})-\left(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}K\right)\circ(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z}).\]

\end_inset

The derivatives 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla K$
\end_inset

 can be replaced by 
\begin_inset Formula $^{(3)}\nabla K$
\end_inset

 because 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 is transverse to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
K(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z}) & =K({}^{(3)}\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z})+K(\mathbf{n}(...),...)=K({}^{(3)}\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z});\\
\left(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}K\right)\circ(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z}) & \equiv\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{x}}\left(K(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z})\right)-K(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z})-K(\mathbf{y},\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{z})\\
={}^{(3)}\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} & \left(K(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z})\right)-K({}^{(3)}\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z})-K(\mathbf{y},{}^{(3)}\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{z})\\
 & ={}^{(3)}\left(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}K\right)\circ(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z}).\end{align*}

Boundary term in Einstein-Hilbert action
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Einstein-Hilbert-action}

\end_inset

 we derived the Einstein equation from a variational principle by imposing
 the condition that both 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta g$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla\delta g$
\end_inset

 must vanish on a boundary surface 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$
\end_inset

.
 This is different from the usual condition where only the variation of
 a field is constrained to vanish (but not its derivative).
 The formal reason for imposing the extra condition was the presence of
 a total divergence term, 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{\tilde{\mathcal{M}}}\sqrt{-g}d^{4}p\,\textrm{div}\mathbf{q}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q}$
\end_inset

 is a vector field depending on the 
\emph on

\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla\delta g$
\end_inset

, as defined by Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:variation Ricci}

\end_inset

).
 However, one can cancel this divergence term by subtracting an extra boundary
 term from the Einstein-Hilbert action, thus defining the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

corrected
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 action 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{G}[g]$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
S_{G}\equiv S_{EH}-\oint_{\partial\tilde{\mathcal{M}}}2K\sqrt{h}\textrm{d}^{3}p,\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 is a suitable function (the factor 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 is for later convenience), and 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 is the induced metric on the 3-surface 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$
\end_inset

.
 In this section, we show how to choose the required function 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 so that the variation of the action 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{G}[g]$
\end_inset

 yields simply
\begin_inset Formula \[
\delta S_{G}[g]=\int_{\tilde{\mathcal{M}}}\sqrt{-g}\textrm{d}^{4}p\left(R_{\mu\nu}-\frac{1}{2}Rg_{\mu\nu}\right)\delta g^{\mu\nu}(p),\]

\end_inset

without any total divergence terms.
 The only boundary condition will be that 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta g^{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 should vanish on 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An analogy with ordinary mechanics may be helpful.
 Consider the familiar nonrelativistic Lagrangian
\begin_inset Formula \[
L(q,\dot{q})=\frac{1}{2}m\dot{q}^{2}-V(q),\]

\end_inset

describing a particle of mass 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 in a potential 
\begin_inset Formula $V(q)$
\end_inset

.
 This Lagrangian yields the same Euler-Lagrange equations as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tilde{L}(q,\dot{q},\ddot{q})=-\frac{1}{2}mq\ddot{q}-V(q).\]

\end_inset

However, the Lagrangian 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{L}$
\end_inset

 depends on the second derivative of 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

.
 The variation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{L}$
\end_inset

 with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta q(t)$
\end_inset

 contains boundary terms with 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\dot{q}(t)$
\end_inset

 as well as 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta q(t)$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\delta\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\tilde{L}\textrm{d}t=-\left.\frac{1}{2}mq\delta\dot{q}\right|_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}+\left.\frac{1}{2}m\dot{q}\delta q\right|_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}-\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\negmedspace\left(m\ddot{q}+V'(q)\right)\delta q(t)\textrm{d}t.\]

\end_inset

 At first glance, we are required to impose the boundary conditions 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\dot{q}(t)=\delta q(t)=0$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $t=t_{1,2}$
\end_inset

.
 However, the problem with the Lagrangian 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{L}$
\end_inset

 can be fixed by adding a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

boundary term,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 so that the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

corrected
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 action becomes
\begin_inset Formula \[
S_{\textrm{corr}}[q]=\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\tilde{L}(q,\dot{q},\ddot{q})dt+\left.\frac{1}{2}mq\dot{q}\right|_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}.\]

\end_inset

The variation of the boundary term is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\delta\left.\frac{1}{2}mq\dot{q}\right|_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}=\left.\frac{1}{2}mq\delta\dot{q}\right|_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}+\left.\frac{1}{2}m\dot{q}\delta q\right|_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}},\]

\end_inset

which precisely cancels the unwanted term with 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\dot{q}$
\end_inset

 in the variation 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\tilde{L}$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the quantity

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{extrinsic curvature}

of the 3-surface 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$

\begin_inset Formula \[
K=\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})}K_{\partial\tilde{\mathcal{M}}}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=g^{\mu\nu}K_{\mu\nu}=h^{\mu\nu}K_{\mu\nu}.\]

 However, the function

\begin_layout Standard
We begin with Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:delta q ans}

\end_inset

),
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{q})=n_{\beta}\!\left(\delta g^{\alpha\beta}{}_{;\alpha}-g_{\mu\nu}\delta g^{\mu\nu;\beta}\right)\!=-n^{\beta}g^{\mu\nu}\!\left(\delta g_{\mu\beta;\nu}-\delta g_{\mu\nu;\beta}\right).\label{eq:g n q 1}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Since the variation 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta g^{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 of the metric vanishes on 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$
\end_inset

, it follows that any tangential derivative of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta g$
\end_inset

 vanishes.
 Since the inverse partial metric 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{\alpha\beta}$
\end_inset

 consists of tensor products of tangential vectors, we have
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
h^{\alpha\beta}\delta g_{\mu\nu;\alpha}=0.\label{eq:h delta g transverse}\end{equation}

\end_inset

Substituting 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{\mu\nu}=h^{\mu\nu}+n^{\mu}n^{\nu}$
\end_inset

 into Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:g n q 1}

\end_inset

), we therefore find
\begin_inset Formula \[
g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{q})=-n^{\beta}h^{\mu\nu}\left(\delta g_{\mu\beta;\nu}-\delta g_{\mu\nu;\beta}\right)=n^{\beta}h^{\mu\nu}\delta g_{\mu\nu;\beta}.\]

\end_inset

 On the other hand, we consider the variation 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta K$
\end_inset

 due to the variation 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta g$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta g=0$
\end_inset

 on the surface 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$
\end_inset

, the vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 remains normalized and orthogonal to the surface, and the only varying
 quantity is the Levi-Civita connection 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla$
\end_inset

, thus
\begin_inset Formula \[
\delta K\equiv h^{\mu\nu}\left(\tilde{\nabla}_{\mu}n_{\nu}-\nabla_{\mu}n_{\nu}\right)=-\delta\Gamma_{\mu\nu}^{\alpha}h^{\mu\nu}n_{\alpha}.\]

\end_inset

Using Eqs.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:variation Gamma}

\end_inset

) and (
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:h delta g transverse}

\end_inset

), we find
\begin_inset Formula \[
\delta K=-\frac{1}{2}h^{\alpha\beta}n^{\mu}\left(\delta g_{\mu\alpha;\beta}+\delta g_{\mu\beta;\alpha}-\delta g_{\alpha\beta;\mu}\right)=\frac{1}{2}h^{\alpha\beta}n^{\mu}\delta g_{a\beta;\mu}.\]

\end_inset

 Therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
2\delta K=h^{\alpha\beta}n^{\mu}\delta g_{a\beta;\mu}=g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{q})\]

\end_inset

as required.

 Then one can show that 
\begin_inset Formula $R-\textrm{div}\mathbf{B}$

 This can be shown, for instance, by considering a conformal transformation
 
\begin_inset Formula $g\rightarrow\tilde{g}\equiv e^{2\lambda}g$

 One computes 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{R}-\tilde{\textrm{div}}\tilde{\mathbf{B}}$

 cancels with the terms

 coming from

Thus, the explicit form of

 depends not only on

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{B}$
\end_inset

 in the interior of the domain 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathcal{M}}$

 Therefore, it is impossible to write the first-order action

 In a particular coordinate system, the vector field

 This means that

 This choice of the time foliation, called the

 may be impossible to perform globally due to focusing of the field

 However, this choice is always possible locally, because one can emit timelike
 geodesics normal to an arbitrary initial spacelike surface and use the
 proper time along the geodesics as the coordinate 
\begin_inset Formula $t$

 It is also convenient to choose the local coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{a}$

 within a surface 
\begin_inset Formula $t=\textrm{const}$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{n}}\mathbf{e}_{a}=0$

\end_inset

 Hence, in a basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{n},\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c}\right\} $
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c}$

 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{-g}=\sqrt{-h}$

\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{-g}\textrm{d}^{4}x=\sqrt{-h}\textrm{d}t\wedge\textrm{d}^{3}x_{a}$

\begin_inset Formula \[

\end_inset

since the basis vectors in the 3-surface commute with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}\equiv\partial_{t}$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{n}}\mathbf{e}_{a}=0$

\begin_inset Formula \[

\end_inset

 Hence, for tangent vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 we have
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
\left(\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{n}}h\right)\circ(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}) & =\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{n}}\left(h(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\right)-h(\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{n}}\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})-h(\mathbf{x},\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{n}}\mathbf{y})\nonumber \\

where 
\begin_inset Formula $K(\cdot,\cdot)$

 Therefore,

\begin_layout Standard
The 3-dimensional curvature

 is defined as the 3-dimensional trace of the induced Riemann tensor

 with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{c}\right)$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{d}\right)$

 Since

\begin_inset Formula $^{(3)}\textrm{Tr}$
\end_inset

 of any tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 can be expressed through its 4-dimensional trace as
\begin_inset Formula \[
^{(3)}\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})}A(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})={}^{(4)}\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})}A(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})-A(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{n}).\]

\end_inset

The Gauss-Codazzi equation\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Gauss-Codazzi 1}

\begin_inset Formula \[

\end_inset

We begin by evaluating the 3-dimensional trace of the above equation over
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z}\right)$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
^{(3)}\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})}{}^{(3)}R(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z},\mathbf{t})\,= & ^{(3)}\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})}{}^{(4)}R(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z},\mathbf{t})\\
+{}^{(3)}\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})} & K(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{t})K(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z})-K(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{t})\textrm{Tr }K\\
={}^{(4)}\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})} & ^{(4)}R(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z},\mathbf{t})-{}^{(4)}R(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{y},\mathbf{n},\mathbf{t})\\
+{}^{(3)}\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})} & K(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{t})K(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z})-K(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{t})K_{a}^{a},\end{align*}

\end_inset

where we wrote 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{a}^{a}\equiv{}^{(3)}\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})}K(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$
\end_inset

.
 Then we evaluate the 3-trace of the result over 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{t}\right)$
\end_inset

, using the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $R(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{n},\cdot,\cdot)=0$
\end_inset

 and hence
\begin_inset Formula \[
^{(3)}\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})}{}^{(4)}R(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{n},\mathbf{z})={}^{(4)}\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})}{}^{(4)}R(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{n},\mathbf{z}).\]

\end_inset

We find
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
^{(3)}R\equiv{}{}^{(3)}\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{t})}{}^{(3)}R(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z},\mathbf{t})\,= & ^{(4)}R\\
-2{}^{(4)}\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})}{}^{(4)}R(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{n},\mathbf{z}) & +K_{ab}K^{ab}-K_{a}^{a}K_{b}^{b}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

It remains to compute the term 
\begin_inset Formula $^{(4)}\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})}{}^{(4)}R(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{n},\mathbf{z})$
\end_inset

.
 I shall present a computation in the index notation and also an index-free
 computation, for comparison.
 Let us first convert this term to the index notation:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})}{}^{(4)}R(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{n},\mathbf{z}) & \equiv\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})}z^{\delta}g_{\gamma\delta}n^{\alpha}x^{\beta}\left[\nabla_{\alpha},\nabla_{\beta}\right]n^{\gamma}\\
=g^{\beta\gamma}g_{\gamma\delta}n^{\alpha} & \left[\nabla_{\alpha},\nabla_{\beta}\right]n^{\gamma}=n^{\alpha}\left[\nabla_{\alpha},\nabla_{\beta}\right]n^{\beta}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

The last expression is simplified as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
n^{\alpha}n^{\beta}{}_{;\beta\alpha}-n^{\alpha}n^{\beta}{}_{;\alpha\beta} & =\left(n^{\alpha}n_{;\beta}^{\beta}\right)_{;\alpha}-n_{;\alpha}^{\alpha}n_{;\beta}^{\beta}-\left(n^{\alpha}n_{;\alpha}^{\beta}\right)_{;\beta}+n_{;\beta}^{\alpha}n_{;\alpha}^{\beta}\\
 & =\textrm{div}\left(...\right)+K_{\alpha\beta}K^{\alpha\beta}-K_{\alpha}^{\alpha}K_{\beta}^{\beta},\end{align*}

\end_inset

where we used the relation 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{\alpha\beta}=n_{\alpha;\beta}$
\end_inset

 and omitted the uninteresting total divergence terms.
 Finally, we obtain
\begin_inset Formula \[
^{(3)}R\equiv{}^{(4)}R-K_{ab}K^{ab}+K_{a}^{a}K_{b}^{b}+\textrm{div}\left(...\right),\]

\end_inset

which is equivalent to Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:R4 through R3}

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the index-free notation, the manipulations with traces are somewhat less
 transparent.
 We need to use the property that mute vectors have vanishing derivatives
 under the trace operation, as well as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
A(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z},...)=\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})}g(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{x})A(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z},...)\]

\end_inset

 (see Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Index-free-trace}

\end_inset

).
 Also, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}\mathbf{n}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $K(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=K(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

.
 Thus,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})} & ^{(4)}R(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{n},\mathbf{z})=\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})}g(\mathbf{z},\nabla_{\mathbf{n}}\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{n}+\nabla_{\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{n}}\mathbf{n})\\
= & \textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})}\left[g(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{n})g(\mathbf{z},\nabla_{\mathbf{b}}\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{n})+g(\mathbf{a},\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{n})g(\mathbf{z},\nabla_{\mathbf{b}}\mathbf{n})\right].\end{align*}

\end_inset

The second term in brackets yields directly 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})}g(\mathbf{a},\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{n})g(\mathbf{z},\nabla_{\mathbf{b}}\mathbf{n})=\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})}K(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{x})K(\mathbf{z},\mathbf{b})=K_{ab}K^{ab},\]

\end_inset

 while the first term in brackets is transformed as
\begin_inset Formula \[
g(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{n})g(\mathbf{z},\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{n})=\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\left[g(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{n})g(\mathbf{z},\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{n})\right]-g(\mathbf{b},\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{n})g(\mathbf{z},\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{n}),\]

\end_inset

which yields a total divergence and the term
\begin_inset Formula \[
-\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})}g(\mathbf{b},\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{n})g(\mathbf{z},\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{n})=-\left[\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})}K(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})\right]^{2}=-\left(K_{a}^{a}\right)^{2}.\]

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula \[

\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}

\end_inset

This expression is equal to the Hamiltonian density and is constrained to
 vanish.
 Therefore, we may heuristically say that gravity itself has zero local
 energy density.

\begin_layout Standard
An alternative way to derive the Hamiltonian constraint is to relax the
 requirement that the normal vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 be normalized to 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{n})=1$
\end_inset

.
 Instead, let us consider an arbitrary normalization, 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{n})=N^{2}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is a function of space and time.
 Since the extrinsic curvature is a function only of the surface, the relation\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:R4 through R3}

\end_inset

) remains valid, and the only difference in the Lagrangian will be the replaceme
nt of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{-g}$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $N\sqrt{-h}$
\end_inset

.
 The momentum 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{ab}$
\end_inset

 is multiplied by 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

, and finally the Hamiltonian becomes
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{H}=\negmedspace\int_{t=\textrm{const}}\negmedspace d^{3}x\frac{N\sqrt{-h}}{16\pi G}\left[K^{ab}K_{ab}-K_{a}^{a}K_{b}^{b}-{}^{(3)}R\right].\]

\end_inset

The variation of this Hamiltonian with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $N$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}=0$

We have computed the Hamiltonian in the syncronous gauge for simplicity,

 Suppose that a function 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is given on a spacetime, such that the contravariant gradient vector 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{-1}dt$
\end_inset

 We may use the function 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 as the time coordinate and define equal-time 3-surfaces 
\begin_inset Formula $t=\textrm{const}$
\end_inset

 Let us define the normal vector to the 3-surfaces, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}\equiv N\hat{g}^{-1}\textrm{d}t$

\begin_inset Formula $N$

\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{n},\mathbf{n})=1$

\begin_inset Formula $N^{-2}=g^{-1}(\textrm{d}t,\textrm{d}t)$
\end_inset

 The local coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{a}$
\end_inset

 on these 3-surfaces may be chosen arbitrarily.
 Given a choice of the local coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{a}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{t}$

\begin_inset Formula $f(t,x_{a})$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $f\rightarrow\partial f/\partial t$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $x_{a}$
\end_inset

 The vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{t}$
\end_inset

 is not necessarily parallel to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula \[
g(\mathbf{n},\partial_{t})=Ng(\hat{g}^{-1}\textrm{d}t,\partial_{t})=N\left(\textrm{d}t\right)\circ\left(\partial_{t}\right)=N,\]

\end_inset

 hence in general we can decompose 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{t}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\partial_{t}=N\mathbf{n}+\mathbf{s},\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}$
\end_inset

 is a spacelike vector tangent to the surface 
\begin_inset Formula $t=\textrm{const}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{s}=\sum_{a=1}^{3}s^{a}\mathbf{e}_{a}$

Let us now determine the induced metric 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 within the 3-surfaces.
 The matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{ab}\equiv g(\mathbf{e}_{a},\mathbf{e}_{b})$
\end_inset

 is related to the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 in the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \partial_{t},\mathbf{e}_{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

 by the following matrix representation (verify this!),
\begin_inset Formula \[
g_{\mu\nu}=\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
N^{2}+h(\mathbf{s},\mathbf{s}) & s_{1} & s_{2} & s_{3}\\
s_{1} & h_{11} & h_{12} & h_{13}\\
s_{2} & h_{21} & h_{22} & h_{23}\\

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{a}\equiv h_{ab}s^{a}$
\end_inset

 It follows from this representation that the determinants of 
\begin_inset Formula $g$

\begin_inset Formula $h$

\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{-g}=N\sqrt{-h}$

 To compute

 the linear combination of the other three rows with coefficients

The action\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset Formula $^{(3)}R$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $K_{ab}$
\end_inset

.
 The relationship between the extrinsic curvature 
\begin_inset Formula $K(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=h(\mathbf{x},\nabla_{\mathbf{y}}\mathbf{n})$
\end_inset

 and the metric derivatives 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial h_{ab}/\partial t$
\end_inset

 needs to be derived now.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{t}$
\end_inset

 is a connecting vector for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{a}$
\end_inset

, we have
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\frac{\partial h_{ab}}{\partial t} & \equiv\partial_{t}\circ\left[h(\mathbf{e}_{a},\mathbf{e}_{b})\right]=\mathcal{L}_{\partial_{t}}\left[h(\mathbf{e}_{a},\mathbf{e}_{b})\right]\\
 & =\left(\mathcal{L}_{\partial_{t}}h\right)\circ(\mathbf{e}_{a},\mathbf{e}_{b}),\end{align*}

\end_inset

and hence for arbitrary vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 tangent to a 3-surface, we find, similarly to Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Lnh and K}

\end_inset

),
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\mathcal{L}_{\partial_{t}}h\right)\circ(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=h(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\partial_{t},\mathbf{y})+h(\mathbf{x},\nabla_{\mathbf{y}}\partial_{t}).\]

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $h(\mathbf{n},\cdot)=0$
\end_inset

, we can simplify the above terms, e.g.
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
h(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\partial_{t},\mathbf{y}) & =h(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}(N\mathbf{n}+\mathbf{s}),\mathbf{y})\\
 & =Nh(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{n},\mathbf{y})+h(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{s},\mathbf{y})\\
 & =NK(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})+h({}^{(3)}\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{s},\mathbf{y}).\end{align*}

\end_inset

In the last line, we replaced 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $^{(3)}\nabla$
\end_inset

 since, by definition,
\begin_inset Formula \[
h({}^{(3)}\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z})\equiv g(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z})\]

\end_inset

 for tangent vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z}$
\end_inset

.
 Hence,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\partial h_{ab}/\partial t=2NK_{ab}+s_{a|b}+s_{b|a},\]

\end_inset

where we denote 
\begin_inset Formula $^{(3)}\nabla_{a}$
\end_inset

 by a vertical bar.

It now follows from Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:R4 through R3}

\end_inset

 does not depend on the time derivatives of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{a}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, we do not need to introduce the canonical momenta for these
 nondynamical variables.
 As before, the only canonical momenta are 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{ab}$
\end_inset

 corresponding to the components 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{ab}$
\end_inset

 of the induced 3-metric, and a simple calculation shows that 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{ab}$

 is still related to 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{ab}$
\end_inset

 by Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:pab K}

\end_inset

 Hence, the Hamiltonian is
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\mathcal{H} & =\int d^{3}x_{a}\frac{\sqrt{-h}}{16\pi G}\left[\left(K^{ab}K_{ab}-K_{a}^{a}K_{b}^{b}-{}^{(3)}R\right)N\right.\\
 & \left.-\left(K^{ab}-K_{c}^{c}h^{ab}\right)_{|a}s_{b}\right].\end{align*}

A complete derivation of the Hamiltonian in an arbitrary gauge (including
 also a detailed treatment of all the boundary terms) can be found in the

Since classical General Relativity is a constrained theory, the constraints

 A comprehensive treatment of quantization for constrained systems is beyond

 view that the constraint equations, which are of the form

The time independence of the wave function may appear to be a puzzling feature
 of the theory.
 However, it is a necessary feature: In a generally covariant theory, the
 time parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is an arbitrary label on events in spacetime, and physically meaningful
 probabilities must be defined in terms of coordinate-independent functionals
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{ab}$

Although we wrote the equations for quantized General Relativity, it remains
 difficult to extract any tangible results from these equations.
 Quite apart from the problem of solving the highly complicated equation\InsetSpace ~

\series bold
operator ordering

:
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{operator ordering}

\end_inset

 The Hamiltonian 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{H}$
\end_inset

 is a nonlinear function of 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{ab}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{ab}$
\end_inset

, containing terms such as 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{ab}h_{cd}p^{ac}p^{bd}$
\end_inset

, hence it is unclear how to order these noncommuting operators in the quantum
 Hamiltonian 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\mathcal{H}}$
\end_inset

.
 The quantum Hamiltonian is thus not a well-defined operator unless we adopt
 a particular prescription for the operator ordering.
 To determine the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

correct
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 operator ordering, one needs to compute some predictions of the quantum
 theory with one or another operator ordering and to compare these predictions
 with experiments or with other known results.
 Such computations are generally too difficult, and thus the Wheeler-DeWitt
 equation\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:WdW equation}

) remains, in its full generality, a formula without application.
 (However, below we shall see that the Wheeler-DeWitt equation can be transforme
d into a differential equation and solved, if one restricts gravity and
 matter fields to spatially homogeneous configurations.)

\begin_layout Subsection
Interpretation of the wave function
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even if one somehow computes the wave function of the universe 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

, its interpretation is nontrivial, mainly because the functional 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi[h_{ab},\phi_{j}]$
\end_inset

 is independent from the time parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 This fact, however, does not mean that the theory always describes a 
\emph on
static
\emph default
 universe! A physically meaningful 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 must be defined not as the value of the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, which can be changed by a coordinate transformation, but through some
 physical process (a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

clock
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 Since the wave function of the universe contains information about all
 the processes through its dependence on 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{ab}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{j}$
\end_inset

, the theory can describe an evolving universe if an appropriate 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

clock process
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 could be found.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to realize that the clock process must be realized by an
 
\emph on
essentially classical
\emph default
 rather than by an essentially quantum physical system.
 In the quantum language, the generalized coordinate describing the clock
 process must exhibit very small quantum fluctuations around a large expectation
 value.
 If the universe were in a quantum state 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$
\end_inset

 in which quantum fluctuations of every variable (including the metric)
 are significant, one could not expect to observe anything resembling a
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

flow of time.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Therefore, even the 
\emph on
possibility
\emph default
 of an interpretation of the wave function of the universe depends on the
 existence of (nearly) classical systems in the universe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose that a nearly classical subsystem exists and is described by a variable
 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{c}$
\end_inset

.
 According to a standard result of quantum mechanics, the wave function
 of the subsystem is of the semiclassical (WKB) type,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\psi(\phi_{c})\propto\exp\left(-\text{i}S_{cl}(\phi_{c})\right),\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{cl}(\phi_{c})$
\end_inset

 is the value of the classical action on a classical trajectory 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(t)$
\end_inset

, expressed as a function of the value of the variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{c}$
\end_inset

 at a final time,
\begin_inset Formula \[
S_{cl}(\phi_{c})=\int_{t_{0}}^{t}L_{\phi_{c}}(\phi,\dot{\phi})dt,\quad\phi(t)=\phi_{c}.\]

\end_inset

The total wave function of the universe is a product of the semiclassical
 part 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi(\phi_{c})$
\end_inset

 and the quantum part 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{q}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Psi[h_{ab},\phi_{j}]=\exp\left(-\text{i}S_{cl}(\phi_{c})\right)\Psi_{q}[\phi_{c};h_{ab},\phi_{j}].\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us now see how the variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{c}$
\end_inset

 can be used as a clock process.
 The trajectory 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{c}(t)$
\end_inset

 of the classical subsystem is, at least locally, a monotonic function of
 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{c}$
\end_inset

 can be used as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and then the quantum part of the wave function, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi_{q}[\phi_{c};h_{ab},\phi_{j}]$
\end_inset

, becomes a time-dependent wave function for the quantum variables 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{ab},\phi_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 One can show (see e.g.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{Vile89}

\end_inset

) that a Schrdinger-type equation holds for this wave function, the variable
 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{c}$

\begin_inset Formula $\Psi$

\series bold
cosmology

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{cosmology}

where one considers only the gross features of the universe, that is, fields
 averaged over astronomically large scales.
 Astronomical observations offer a strong evidence that the universe around
 us is extremely homogeneous on large scales.
 Therefore, in cosmology one usually assumes that the 3-surfaces of constant
 time are spatially homogeneous.
 In other words, the 3-metric 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{ab}(t)$
\end_inset

 and the fields 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{j}(t)$
\end_inset

 depend only on the time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and are independent of the spatial coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{c}$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, we are motivated to consider the theory of quantized gravity with
 spatially homogeneous metric and fields.
 The corresponding simplification of the WD equation consists of reducing
 the infinite-dimensional superspace to a finite-dimensional space containing
 3-metrics 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{ab}$
\end_inset

 and field configurations 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{j}$

To be specific, let us consider a model of classical spacetime whose equal-time
 surfaces are homogeneous 3-spheres 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{3}$
\end_inset

 (hence, a closed universe!) with a fixed 3-metric 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 The spacetime metric is
\begin_inset Formula \[
g=N^{2}(t)\textrm{d}t\otimes\textrm{d}t-a^{2}(t)\gamma,\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $N(t)$

 is the lapse function and

\end_inset

 is an unknown function of time called the 
\series bold
scale factor
\series default
.
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{scale factor}

\end_inset

 Since the lapse function is nondynamical, the scale factor is the only
 physical variable in the gravitational sector of the model.
 Further, suppose there exists a scalar field 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(t)$
\end_inset

 which is, again, independent of the spatial coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{c}$
\end_inset

 Thus the minisuperspace is two-dimensional and consists of two variables,
 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 We shall now quantize this cosmological model using the WD equation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We need to express the classical Hamiltonian\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Hamiltonian for GR}

\end_inset

) for gravity through the variable 
\begin_inset Formula $a(t)$
\end_inset

, and add the Hamiltonian for the scalar field 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{H}_{\phi}=\int_{t=\textrm{const}}\negmedspace\textrm{d}^{3}x_{c}N\sqrt{-h}\left[\frac{1}{2}p_{\phi}^{2}+h^{ab}\phi_{,a}\phi_{,b}+V(\phi)\right],\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{\phi}$
\end_inset

 is the canonical momentum for 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula \[
V(\phi)\equiv\Lambda+\frac{1}{2}m^{2}\phi^{2}+O(\phi^{3})\]

\end_inset

 is a potential describing the vacuum energy density 
\begin_inset Formula $\Lambda$
\end_inset

, the mass 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

, and a possible self-interaction of the field 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

.
 The partial metric 
\begin_inset Formula $h=-a^{2}\gamma$
\end_inset

, so 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{-h}=a^{3}\sqrt{\gamma}$
\end_inset

.
 Since the field 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 is spatially homogeneous, we may integrate over 3-spheres, assuming that
 the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 is normalized so that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int_{t=\textrm{const}}\negmedspace\textrm{d}^{3}x_{c}\sqrt{\gamma}=\sigma_{3}=2\pi^{2},\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sigma_{n}\equiv\frac{2\pi^{n/2}}{\Gamma(n/2)}\]

\end_inset

 is the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-volume of a unit 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-sphere 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{n}$
\end_inset

.
 (This normalization of the 3-metric 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 means that the radius of the 3-sphere is equal to 1.) Thus we obtain
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{H}_{\phi}=Na^{3}\sigma_{3}\left[\frac{1}{2}p_{\phi}^{2}+V(\phi)\right].\]

\end_inset

Returning to the gravitational sector of the model, we need to compute the
 3-curvature scalar 
\begin_inset Formula $^{(3)}R$
\end_inset

 and the extrinsic curvature tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{ab}$
\end_inset

.
 The 3-curvature 
\begin_inset Formula $^{(3)}R$
\end_inset

 depends only on the intrinsic geometry of the 3-surface 
\begin_inset Formula $t=\textrm{const}$
\end_inset

, which is a 3-sphere 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{3}$
\end_inset

 with the natural metric and radius 
\begin_inset Formula $a(t)$
\end_inset

, and thus a space of constant curvature; the value of the curvature is
 
\begin_inset Formula $a^{-1}(t)$
\end_inset

.
 The 3-dimensional Riemann tensor for a space of constant curvature was
 computed in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Induced-Riemann}

\end_inset

, hence
\begin_inset Formula \[
^{(3)}R(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c},\mathbf{d})=a^{-2}\left(h(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{c})h(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{d})-h(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{d})h(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c})\right).\]

\end_inset

Using
\begin_inset Formula \[
^{(3)}\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})}h(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})=3,\]

\end_inset

we find
\begin_inset Formula \[
^{(3)}R={}^{(3)}\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{c})(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{d})}{}^{(3)}R(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c},\mathbf{d})=6a^{-2}.\]

\end_inset

 It remains to compute the extrinsic curvature.
 We may introduce local coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{a}$
\end_inset

 on a surface 
\begin_inset Formula $t=\textrm{const}$
\end_inset

; however, the explicit form of these coordinates will not be necessary
 for the present calculation.
 It is sufficient to note that the basis 3-vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{a}\equiv\partial_{x_{a}}$
\end_inset

 commute with each other and with 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, from Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:LC connection ans}

\end_inset

) we get
\begin_inset Formula \[
g(\nabla_{\mathbf{e}_{b}}\partial_{t},\mathbf{e}_{c})=\frac{1}{2}\partial_{t}g(\mathbf{e}_{b},\mathbf{e}_{c})=\dot{a}a\gamma(\mathbf{e}_{b},\mathbf{e}_{c})=\frac{\dot{a}}{a}h_{bc}.\]

\end_inset

 Since the normal vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 to the 3-surfaces 
\begin_inset Formula $t=\textrm{const}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}=N^{-1}\partial_{t}$
\end_inset

, the extrinsic curvature tensor is
\begin_inset Formula \[
K\left(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\right)\equiv g(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{n},\mathbf{y})=N^{-1}g(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\partial_{t},\mathbf{y})=N^{-1}\frac{\dot{a}}{a}h(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}).\]

\end_inset

Then we determine the relevant combination of the traces of 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
K_{bc}K^{bc}-K_{b}^{b}K_{c}^{c}=\left(\frac{\dot{a}}{Na}\right)^{2}\left(h_{bc}h^{bc}-h_{b}^{b}h_{c}^{c}\right)=-6\left(\frac{\dot{a}}{Na}\right)^{2}.\]

\end_inset

The gravitational Lagrangian becomes
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\mathcal{L}_{G} & =\negmedspace\int_{t=\textrm{const}}\negmedspace\textrm{d}^{3}x\frac{N\sqrt{-h}}{16\pi G}\left(^{(3)}R+K_{ab}K^{ab}-K_{a}^{a}K_{b}^{b}\right)\\
 & =\negmedspace\int_{t=\textrm{const}}\negmedspace\textrm{d}^{3}x\frac{N\sqrt{-h}}{16\pi G}\left(\frac{6}{a^{2}}-6\left(\frac{\dot{a}}{Na}\right)^{2}\right).\end{align*}

\end_inset

We can now integrate over the 3-volume of the 3-sphere 
\begin_inset Formula $t=\textrm{const}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int_{t=\textrm{const}}\negmedspace\textrm{d}^{3}x\sqrt{-h}=a^{3}\sigma_{3},\]

\end_inset

 because all the terms are spatially homogeneous.
 Therefore,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{L}=\frac{6Na^{3}\sigma_{3}}{16\pi G}\left(\frac{1}{a^{2}}-\frac{\dot{a}^{2}}{N^{2}a^{2}}\right)=\frac{3\pi}{4G}Na\left(1-\frac{1}{N^{2}}\dot{a}^{2}\right).\]

\end_inset

To compute the Hamiltonian, it remains to determine the canonical momentum
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{a}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
p_{a}=\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\dot{a}}=-\frac{3\pi}{2G}\frac{a\dot{a}}{N}.\]

\end_inset

Hence,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\dot{a}=-\frac{2G}{3\pi}\frac{N}{a}p_{a},\]

\end_inset

 and the gravitational Hamiltonian is
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\mathcal{H}_{G}(p_{a},a) & =p_{a}\dot{a}-\mathcal{L}_{G}\\
 & =\frac{-3\pi}{4G}Na+\frac{N}{a}p_{a}^{2}\left(-\frac{2G}{3\pi}+\frac{3\pi}{4G}\frac{4G^{2}}{9\pi^{2}}\right)\\
 & =\frac{-3\pi}{4G}Na-\frac{G}{3\pi}\frac{N}{a}p_{a}^{2}.\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we can write the total Hamiltonian for the minisuperspace theory,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
 & \mathcal{H}\left(p_{a},a,p_{\phi},\phi\right)=\mathcal{H}_{G}+\mathcal{H}_{\phi}\\
 & =\frac{N}{a}\left[-\frac{G}{3\pi}p_{a}^{2}-\frac{3\pi}{4G}a^{2}+a^{4}\sigma_{3}\left(\frac{1}{2}p_{\phi}^{2}+V(\phi)\right)\right].\end{align*}

\end_inset

Therefore, the

wave function of the mini-universe,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\Psi(a,\phi)$

\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
 & \left[-\frac{G}{3\pi}\hat{p}_{a}^{2}-\frac{3\pi}{4G}a^{2}+2\pi^{2}a^{4}\left(\frac{1}{2}\hat{p}_{\phi}^{2}+V(\phi)\right)\right]\Psi\\

\end_inset

This equation needs to be supplemented by boundary conditions.
 However, the choice of the boundary conditions is a subtle problem and
 we shall not discuss this issue here.
 In the present case, we shall simply choose the solution of the WD equation
 that will have a clear physical interpretation.

To visualize the physical interpretation of this solution, we note that
 Eq.\InsetSpace ~

In the standard approach, General Relativity is formulated as a

\end_inset

theory of the metric.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 In other words, the main variable is the metric tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

, while the connection and the curvature are expressed through the metric.
 An alternative formulation is through orthonormal bases of vector fields
 (called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tetrads
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 This formulation is convenient for many calculations, and also serves to
 connect gravity with spinor field theory.
 Some approaches to quantum gravity are based on the tetrad formulation.

 One of the tetrad vectors must be timelike and the other three must be
 spacelike (because the metric

 It is a convention to choose the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{0}$

 timelike and the other three spacelike, so that the scalar product matrix
 is
\begin_inset Formula \[

\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{ab}$

, the components 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{\mu}^{a}(p)$
\end_inset

 of the tetrad may be found by the following procedure.
 At a fixed spacetime point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

, consider the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}(p)$
\end_inset

 as a bilinear form.
 This bilinear form may be diagonalized by a linear coordinate transformation,
 according to standard procedures of linear algebra.
 Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ t,x,y,z\right\} $
\end_inset

 are new coordinates in which the metric is diagonal at the point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

, e.g.
\begin_inset Formula \[
g_{\mu\nu}(p)=\textrm{diag}\left(A,-B,-C,-D\right)\equiv\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
A & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & -B & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & -C & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & -D\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $A,B,C,D>0$
\end_inset

 Then it is easy to write an orthogonal basis in the tangent space 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{p}\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

, for instance 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\mathbf{e}_{0}(p) & =\frac{1}{\sqrt{A}}\partial_{t},\quad\mathbf{e}_{1}(p)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{B}}\partial_{x},\\
\mathbf{e}_{2}(p) & =\frac{1}{\sqrt{C}}\partial_{y},\quad\mathbf{e}_{3}(p)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{D}}\partial_{z}.\end{align*}

 First we need to compute the four 1-forms 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}$

\begin_inset Formula $a=0,1,2,3$

Construction of the dual basis:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We work in the tangent space 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{p}\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 at a point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 of a manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{a}(p)\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a basis in 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{p}\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

, any vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\in T_{p}\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 is uniquely decomposed as a linear combination
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{v}=\sum_{a}\lambda^{a}\mathbf{e}_{a},\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda^{a}$
\end_inset

 are some numbers.
 When the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is fixed, the numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda^{a}$
\end_inset

 are linear functions of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

, and thus are 1-forms which we denote 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}$
\end_inset

; in other words, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda^{a}\equiv\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}(\mathbf{v})$
\end_inset

.
 These 1-forms 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}$
\end_inset

 yield the components of a vector in the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

, so that
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{v}=\sum_{a}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}(\mathbf{v})\mathbf{e}_{a}.\]

\end_inset

This relationship holds for any vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

; sometimes this is written as a decomposition of the identity operator,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\hat{\mathbf{1}}=\sum_{a}\mathbf{e}_{a}\otimes\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}.\label{eq:decomposition of identity in vielbein}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 The set of 1-forms 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is called the 
\series bold
dual tetrad
\series default

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{dual tetrad}

 and is a basis in the dual tangent space 
\begin_inset Formula $T^{*}\mathcal{M}(p)$
\end_inset

 Sometimes one calls 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}$
\end_inset

 simply the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 for brevity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In any case, it is straightforward to pass from 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

 and back.
 In a local coordinate system, the dual basis has components 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{\mu}^{a}$
\end_inset

 which comprise a 
\begin_inset Formula $4\times4$
\end_inset

 matrix satisfying 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{a}\theta_{\mu}^{a}v^{\mu}e_{a}^{\nu}=v^{\nu}\]

\end_inset

for any 
\begin_inset Formula $v^{\mu}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{a}\theta_{\mu}^{a}e_{a}^{\nu}=\delta_{\mu}^{\nu},\]

\end_inset

so the matrix of components 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{\mu}^{a}$
\end_inset

 can be computed as the inverse matrix to 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{a}^{\mu}$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Standard
Once the 1-forms 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $a=0,1,2,3$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is expressed as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
g(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})=g\left(\sum_{a}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}(\mathbf{u})\mathbf{e}_{a},\sum_{b}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{b}(\mathbf{v})\mathbf{e}_{b}\right)=\sum_{a,b}\eta_{ab}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}(\mathbf{u})\boldsymbol{\theta}^{b}(\mathbf{v}).\label{eq:metric through dual tetrad}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Rewritten in a more condensed notation, the above formula becomes
\begin_inset Formula \[
g=\sum_{a,b}\eta_{ab}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}\otimes\boldsymbol{\theta}^{b}.\]

\end_inset

In components,
\begin_inset Formula \[
g_{\mu\nu}=\sum_{a,b}\eta_{ab}\theta_{\mu}^{a}\theta_{\nu}^{b}.\]

\end_inset

This is an explicit formula that expresses the metric tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 through the dual tetrad.
 Analogously, the inverse metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{-1}$
\end_inset

 is expressed through the tetrad vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula \[
g^{-1}=\sum_{a,b}\eta^{ab}\mathbf{e}_{a}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{b}.\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, in order to define a metric structure on a manifold, one may specify
 a tetrad 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

 or alternatively a dual tetrad 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}\right\} $

 A vector

\begin_inset Formula \[

This map

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{4}$

 defined by the matrix

A tetrad is essentially a set of four vector fields which must be linearly

 Since it is impossible to have globally nonzero vector fields on some manifolds

\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{a}(p)\right\} $

 might have to be defined only locally.
 In other words, different tetrad fields will have to be defined within
 different charts covering the manifold.

It is clear that the 1-forms

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is an arbitrary vector.
 In the notation of Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Correspondence-of-vectors}

\begin_inset Formula \[
\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}=\eta_{aa}\hat{g}\mathbf{e}_{a}=\sum_{b}\eta^{ab}\hat{g}\mathbf{e}_{b}.\]

(There is no summation over 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 in the expressions 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{aa}\hat{g}\mathbf{e}_{a}$
\end_inset

 using the fiducial Minkowski metric 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta^{ab}$

 Thus, one defines
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\theta}_{a}\equiv\eta_{aa}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}=\sum_{b}\eta_{ab}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{b}\label{eq:theta lower}\end{equation}

 These functions could serve as a local coordinate system

 naturally adapted to the given basis

\begin_layout Standard
It is easy to recognize a holonomic basis by checking that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{d}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}=0$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

.
 For example, a basis of 1-forms 
\begin_inset Formula $\{ t^{2}\mbox{d}t,x\mbox{d}x+y\mbox{d}y,x\mbox{d}y+y\mbox{d}x,\mbox{d}z\}$
\end_inset

 is holonomic.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, when an 
\emph on
orthonormal
\emph default
 basis is holonomic, it means that there exist coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x^{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

 in which the 1-forms 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{d}x^{a}$
\end_inset

 are orthogonal.
 In other words, these are Cartesian coordinates and the metric is simply
 the flat Euclidean (or Minkowski) metric.
 It is impossible to choose an orthonormal holonomic basis of 1-forms in
 a nonflat spacetime.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The condition on the basis vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{a}$
\end_inset

 that indicates a holonomic basis is mutual commutation.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a holonomic basis, then there exist a coordinate system 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x^{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}=\mbox{d}x^{a}$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, the dual basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

 will consist of vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{a}=\partial_{x^{a}}$
\end_inset

 and hence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathbf{e}_{a},\mathbf{e}_{b}\right]=0$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $a,b$
\end_inset

.
 This is the property that indicates a holonomic basis.
 In a nonflat spacetime, an 
\emph on
orthonormal
\emph default
 basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

 will be necessarily nonholonomic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is true that in almost all cases we will be working in a nonflat spacetime,
 and hence the vielbein will be nonholonomic.
 However, to me this is not a sufficient motivation to call 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

 a nonholonomic basis.
 What is important for our considerations is the 
\emph on
orthonormality
\emph default
 of the chosen frame basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

 with respect to the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 Calling 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

 merely a nonholonomic basis may create an impression that it is sufficient
 to select 
\emph on
some
\emph default
 nonholonomic basis, whether orthonormal or not.
 However, an arbitrary non-orthonormal, nonholonomic basis is much less
 useful in calculations than an orthonormal basis.
 For this reason, we call

\end_inset

 an

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the Schwarzschild metric\InsetSpace ~
(

).
 The task is to determine a tetrad basis and a dual tetrad basis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the metric is in a diagonal form, a possible choice of the tetrad
 is
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\mathbf{e}_{0} & =\left(1-\frac{2M}{r}\right)^{-1/2}\partial_{t},\quad\mathbf{e}_{1}=\left(1-\frac{2M}{r}\right)^{1/2}\partial_{r},\\
\mathbf{e}_{2} & =\frac{1}{r}\partial_{\theta},\quad\mathbf{e}_{3}=\frac{1}{r\sin\theta}\partial_{\phi}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Note that the tetrad is undefined (singular) if 
\begin_inset Formula $r=0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $r=2M$
\end_inset

, or 
\begin_inset Formula $\sin\theta=0$
\end_inset

 because at these locations the coordinate system 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(t,r,\theta,\phi\right)$
\end_inset

 and/or the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 are singular.
 This is an example of a tetrad defined only 
\emph on
locally
\emph default
, that is, only within a certain limited coordinate patch, rather than globally
 in the entire spacetime.
 More than one coordinate patch must be used to cover the entire Schwarzschild
 spacetime.

\end_inset

 and the frame fields
\begin_inset Formula \[

\end_inset

The task is to determine the metric tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 such that this frame is orthonormal.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can recover the metric by first determining the dual frame,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\boldsymbol{\theta}^{0}=\textrm{d}t,\quad\boldsymbol{\theta}^{1}=e^{Ht}\textrm{d}x,\]

\end_inset

and then writing
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
g & =\sum_{a,b}\eta_{ab}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}\otimes\boldsymbol{\theta}^{b}=\textrm{d}t\otimes\textrm{d}t-e^{2Ht}\textrm{d}x\otimes\textrm{d}x\\

\begin_layout Standard
We work with a four-dimensional manifold where the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 and the Levi-Civita tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$
\end_inset

 are known.
 First consider a 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

.
 The Hodge duality map yields a 3-form 
\begin_inset Formula $^{*}\omega$
\end_inset

 called the 
\series bold
Hodge dual
\series default
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

; this operation is also called the 
\series bold
Hodge star
\series default
.
 The 3-form 
\begin_inset Formula $*\omega$
\end_inset

 is defined by its action on arbitrary vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{z}$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(^{*}\omega\right)\circ(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z})\equiv\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\hat{g}^{-1}\omega,\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z}).\]

\end_inset

Somewhat more awkwardly, this definition can be rewritten as
\begin_inset Formula \[
*\omega=\iota_{\hat{g}^{-1}\omega}\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}.\]

\end_inset

It is clear that 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\mapsto*\omega$
\end_inset

 is a linear map in 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 (if we regard the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 and the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$
\end_inset

 as fixed).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a four-dimensional Minkowski space with the orthonormal basis of
 1-forms 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \textrm{d}t,\textrm{d}x,\textrm{d}y,\textrm{d}z\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 The Levi-Civita tensor is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}=\textrm{d}t\wedge\textrm{d}x\wedge\textrm{d}y\wedge\textrm{d}z.\]

\end_inset

Let us compute the Hodge star applied to the 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}t$
\end_inset

.
 Using the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{g}^{-1}\textrm{d}t=\partial_{t}$
\end_inset

, we find 
\begin_inset Formula \[
*(\textrm{d}t)=\iota_{\partial_{t}}\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}=\textrm{d}x\wedge\textrm{d}y\wedge\textrm{d}z.\]

\end_inset

Similarly, we have
\begin_inset Formula \[
*(\textrm{d}x)=\iota_{\partial_{x}}\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}=-\textrm{d}t\wedge\textrm{d}y\wedge\textrm{d}z.\]

\end_inset

Heuristically, 
\begin_inset Formula $*\omega$
\end_inset

 must contain the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

complement
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\wedge*\omega$
\end_inset

 is proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$
\end_inset

.
\hfill

\begin_inset Formula $\blacksquare$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another convenient way to express 
\begin_inset Formula $*\omega$
\end_inset

 is to use an orthonormal basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 Since
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{g}^{-1}\omega=\sum_{a,b}\eta^{ab}\left(\iota_{\mathbf{e}_{b}}\omega\right)\mathbf{e}_{a},\]

\end_inset

we can write
\begin_inset Formula \[
*\omega=\sum_{a}\eta^{aa}\left(\iota_{\mathbf{e}_{a}}\omega\right)\left(\iota_{\mathbf{e}_{a}}\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}\right).\]

\end_inset

This expression can be also used as a definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $*\omega$
\end_inset

.
 By construction, this definition is independent of the choice of the basis
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

, as long as this basis is orthonormal with respect to the fixed metric
 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 and positively oriented with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$
\end_inset

.
 (We merely rewrote a basis-free definition in terms of an arbitrary orthonormal
 basis.) The basis independence can be made manifest by expressing 
\begin_inset Formula $*\omega$
\end_inset

 through the trace operation as follows,
\begin_inset Formula \[
*\omega=\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})}\left(\iota_{\mathbf{a}}\omega\right)\left(\iota_{\mathbf{b}}\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}\right).\]

\end_inset

It is clear that this can be used as a definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $*\omega$
\end_inset

 equivalent to the definitions above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly, a 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})$
\end_inset

 is converted to its Hodge dual 
\begin_inset Formula $*\omega$
\end_inset

, which is also a 2-form.
 This 2-form can be defined using an orthonormal basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

 as follows,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
*\omega\equiv\frac{1}{2!}\sum_{a,b}\eta^{aa}\eta^{bb}\left(\iota_{\mathbf{e}_{b}}\iota_{\mathbf{e}_{a}}\omega\right)\left(\iota_{\mathbf{e}_{b}}\iota_{\mathbf{e}_{a}}\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}\right).\label{eq:star 2w ea}\end{equation}

\end_inset

As before, this definition is independent of the choice of the orthonormal
 basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 This can also be seen with the following trick.
 Any 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 can be decomposed into a linear combination of exterior products of 1-forms.
 Since the Hodge duality is a linear map, we only need to consider a single
 exterior product 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega=\phi\wedge\chi$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$
\end_inset

 are 1-forms.
 The 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $*(\phi\wedge\chi)$
\end_inset

 is then expressed as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(*(\phi\wedge\chi)\right)\circ\left(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\right)=\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\hat{g}^{-1}\phi,\hat{g}^{-1}\chi,\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}).\]

\end_inset

It is straightforward to verify that this expression is equivalent to Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:star 2w ea}

\end_inset

).
 When the definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $*\omega$
\end_inset

 is written in this basis-free manner, it becomes manifest that 
\begin_inset Formula $*\omega$
\end_inset

 depends only on the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 but not on the choice of the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 However, calculations using an explicit basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

 are much more convenient since one does not need to decompose all 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-forms into linear combinations of exterior products of 1-forms.
 Sometimes also the index-free trace notation is convenient,
\begin_inset Formula \[
*\omega\equiv\frac{1}{2!}\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{a}')(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{b}')}\left(\iota_{\mathbf{b}'}\iota_{\mathbf{a}'}\omega\right)\left(\iota_{\mathbf{b}}\iota_{\mathbf{a}}\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}\right).\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So far we have seen the definitions of 
\begin_inset Formula $*\omega$
\end_inset

 for 1-forms and 2-forms.
 To express the Hodge dual of an 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega$
\end_inset

, one can build an expression analogous to Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:star 2w ea}

\end_inset

) but with 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 sets of vectors and the factor 
\begin_inset Formula $1/n!$
\end_inset

 in front:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
*\Omega & \equiv\frac{1}{n!}\sum_{a_{1},...,a_{n}}\eta^{a_{1}a_{1}}...\eta^{a_{n}a_{n}}\left(\iota_{\mathbf{e}_{a_{n}}}...\iota_{\mathbf{e}_{a_{1}}}\Omega\right)\left(\iota_{\mathbf{e}_{a_{n}}}...\iota_{\mathbf{e}_{a_{1}}}\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}\right)\\
 & =\frac{1}{n!}\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{a}_{1},\mathbf{b}_{1})...(\mathbf{a}_{n},\mathbf{b}_{n})}\left(\iota_{\mathbf{a}_{n}}...\iota_{\mathbf{a}_{1}}\Omega\right)\left(\iota_{\mathbf{b}_{n}}...\iota_{\mathbf{b}_{1}}\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}\right).\end{align*}

\end_inset

Here we wrote the arguments 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{a_{j}}$
\end_inset

 in the reverse order for convenience; recall that
\begin_inset Formula \[
\iota_{\mathbf{e}_{a_{n}}}...\iota_{\mathbf{e}_{a_{1}}}\Omega\equiv\Omega(\mathbf{e}_{a_{1}},...,\mathbf{e}_{a_{n}}).\]

\end_inset

As before, this definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $*\Omega$
\end_inset

 depends only on the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 and on 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$
\end_inset

 but not on the choice of the orthonormal basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 In four dimensions, the Hodge star establishes a linear map from 0-forms
 (scalars) to 4-forms, from 1-forms to 3-forms, etc.
 In particular, the 4-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$
\end_inset

 is mapped into a scalar.
 The numerical factor 
\begin_inset Formula $1/n!$
\end_inset

 leads to the relation 
\begin_inset Formula $*\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}=-1$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
*\boldsymbol{\varepsilon} & =\frac{1}{4!}\sum_{a,b,c,d}\eta^{aa}...\eta^{dd}\left(\iota_{\mathbf{e}_{d}}...\iota_{\mathbf{e}_{a}}\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}\right)\left(\iota_{\mathbf{e}_{d}}...\iota_{\mathbf{e}_{a}}\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}\right)\\

In four dimensions, one can derive a more convenient formula for the Hodge

It is not particularly easy to perform calculations with the Hodge star
 operation.
 For instance, there are no general identities relating the Hodge star to
 other operations, such as the exterior differential or the Lie derivative;
 so in general 
\begin_inset Formula $*(\omega\wedge\psi)\neq*\omega\wedge*\psi$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}*\omega\neq*\textrm{d}\omega$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{x}}*\omega\neq*\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{x}}\omega$
\end_inset

, etc.
 When doing calculations with the Hodge star, one needs to use either an
 explicit basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

, or the index-free trace formalism.

\end_inset

On the other hand, it is easy to see that
\begin_inset Formula \[
\boldsymbol{\theta}^{0}\wedge*\boldsymbol{\theta}^{1}=0;\quad(\boldsymbol{\theta}^{0}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{1})\wedge*(\boldsymbol{\theta}^{0}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{2})=0;\quad\textrm{etc.}\]

Levi-Civita connection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given a metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

, one may determine the Levi-Civita connection 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla$
\end_inset

 explicitly (see Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:LC connection ans}

\end_inset

) in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Levi-Civita-connection}

\end_inset

).
 It turns out that the Levi-Civita connection can be expressed directly
 through the tetrad.
 We begin by assuming that the metric tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 and the Levi-Civita connection 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla$
\end_inset

 are known, and then derive the formula for the covariant derivative of
 the tetrad field.
 Subsequently, it will be clear how to recover the connection from the tetrad
 without explicitly involving the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given a tetrad 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

, we would like to be able to compute the covariant derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 for arbitrary vector fields 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a basis, every vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 can be expressed through 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{v}=\sum_{a}v^{a}\mathbf{e}_{a},\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $v^{a}\equiv v^{a}(p)$
\end_inset

 is a set of four 
\emph on
scalar
\emph default
 functions (the Latin index is 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 a tensor index).
 Therefore it is sufficient to be able to calculate 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}=\mathbf{e}_{a}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}=\mathbf{e}_{b}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $a,b=0,1,2,3$
\end_inset

.
 According to Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:LC connection ans}

\end_inset

), we have
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z}) & =\frac{1}{2}\big(\mathbf{x}\circ g(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z})+\mathbf{y}\circ g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})-\mathbf{z}\circ g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\\
 & -g(\mathbf{x},[\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z}])-g(\mathbf{y},[\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z}])+g(\mathbf{z},[\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}])\big).\end{align*}

\end_inset

 This formula enables us to calculate 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\nabla_{\mathbf{e}_{a}}\mathbf{e}_{b},\mathbf{e}_{c})$
\end_inset

 if we can evaluate terms such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{a}\circ g(\mathbf{e}_{b},\mathbf{e}_{c})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{e}_{a},[\mathbf{e}_{b},\mathbf{e}_{c}])$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{e}_{b},\mathbf{e}_{c})=\eta_{bc}$
\end_inset

 is (by construction) a fixed numerical matrix, the directional derivatives
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{ab}$
\end_inset

 are zero, so 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{a}\circ g(\mathbf{e}_{b},\mathbf{e}_{c})=0$
\end_inset

.
 Thus we have
\begin_inset Formula \[
g(\nabla_{\mathbf{e}_{a}}\mathbf{e}_{b},\mathbf{e}_{c})=\frac{g(\mathbf{e}_{c},[\mathbf{e}_{a},\mathbf{e}_{b}])-g(\mathbf{e}_{a},[\mathbf{e}_{b},\mathbf{e}_{c}])-g(\mathbf{e}_{b},[\mathbf{e}_{a},\mathbf{e}_{c}])}{2}.\]

\end_inset

We may rewrite this formula using the
\emph on
 lower-index
\emph default
 version of the dual tetrad 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\theta}_{c}$
\end_inset

 [see Eqs.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:theta lower}

\end_inset

) and (
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:theta lower 1}

\end_inset

)] as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\theta}_{c}\circ\nabla_{\mathbf{e}_{a}}\mathbf{e}_{b}=\frac{\boldsymbol{\theta}_{c}\circ[\mathbf{e}_{a},\mathbf{e}_{b}]-\boldsymbol{\theta}_{a}\circ[\mathbf{e}_{b},\mathbf{e}_{c}]-\boldsymbol{\theta}_{b}\circ[\mathbf{e}_{a},\mathbf{e}_{c}]}{2}.\label{eq:Levi-Civita tetrad}\end{equation}

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\theta}^{c}\circ\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is the 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

-th component of a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 in the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

, the formula\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Levi-Civita tetrad}

\end_inset

) completely determines the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{e}_{a}}\mathbf{e}_{b}$
\end_inset

 if the basis vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{a}$
\end_inset

 and their commutators 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathbf{e}_{a},\mathbf{e}_{b}\right]$
\end_inset

 are known.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We point out that the essential information required for computing the covariant
 derivative is the commutators 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathbf{e}_{a},\mathbf{e}_{b}\right]$
\end_inset

.
 In general, these commutators can be expressed as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\mathbf{e}_{a},\mathbf{e}_{b}\right]=\sum_{c}C^{c}{}_{ab}\mathbf{e}_{c},\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $C^{c}{}_{ab}=-C^{c}{}_{ba}$
\end_inset

 are some scalar coefficients (which are, of course, functions of the spacetime
 point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

).
 The coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $C^{c}{}_{ab}$
\end_inset

 can be explicitly computed from 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

 without need to involve the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

; recall that the commutator 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}\right]$
\end_inset

 is a geometric operation defined independently of the metric.
 Then one has complete information about the Levi-Civita connection 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla$
\end_inset

 through Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Levi-Civita tetrad}

\end_inset

).
 The formula\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Levi-Civita tetrad}

\end_inset

) can be rewritten as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\eta_{cc}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{c}\circ\nabla_{\mathbf{e}_{a}}\mathbf{e}_{b}\equiv\boldsymbol{\theta}_{c}\circ\nabla_{\mathbf{e}_{a}}\mathbf{e}_{b}=\frac{1}{2}\left(C_{c\, ab}-C_{b\, ac}-C_{a\, bc}\right),\label{eq:Levi-Civita C0}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{c\, ab}$
\end_inset

 is obtained from 
\begin_inset Formula $C^{c}{}_{ab}$
\end_inset

 by lowering the first index through 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{ac}$
\end_inset

.
 Alternatively, we may write
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\nabla_{\mathbf{e}_{a}}\mathbf{e}_{b}=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{c}\left(C_{c\, ab}-C_{b\, ac}-C_{a\, bc}\right)\eta_{cc}\mathbf{e}_{c}.\label{eq:Levi-Civita C}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 At this point, one can compute covariant derivatives 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 of arbitrary vector fields 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 by expressing them through the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

 and using the Leibnitz rule.

\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$

Let us first determine 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{e}_{a}}\mathbf{e}_{b}$

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $a,b$
\end_inset

.
 We begin by calculating the commutators 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathbf{e}_{a},\mathbf{e}_{b}\right]$
\end_inset

.
 The only nontrivial commutator is
\begin_inset Formula \[
[\mathbf{e}_{0},\mathbf{e}_{1}]=-H\mathbf{e}_{1}.\]

\end_inset

It follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $C^{1}{}_{01}=-C^{1}{}_{10}=-H$
\end_inset

 are the only nonzero coefficients among 
\begin_inset Formula $C^{c}{}_{ab}$
\end_inset

.
 Lowering the first index of 
\begin_inset Formula $C^{c}{}_{ab}$
\end_inset

, we find 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{1\,01}=-C_{1\,10}=H$
\end_inset

.
 Then we use Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Levi-Civita C}

\end_inset

) and compute
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\nabla_{\mathbf{e}_{0}}\mathbf{e}_{0} & =0,\quad(\textrm{no nonzero }C_{c\, ab})\\
\nabla_{\mathbf{e}_{0}}\mathbf{e}_{1} & =\frac{1}{2}\left(C_{1\,01}-C_{1\,01}\right)\eta_{11}\mathbf{e}_{1}=0,\\
\nabla_{\mathbf{e}_{1}}\mathbf{e}_{0} & =\frac{1}{2}\left(C_{1\,10}-C_{1\,01}\right)\eta_{11}\mathbf{e}_{1}=H\mathbf{e}_{1},\\
\nabla_{\mathbf{e}_{1}}\mathbf{e}_{1} & =\frac{1}{2}\left(-C_{1\,10}-C_{1\,10}\right)\eta_{00}\mathbf{e}_{0}=H\mathbf{e}_{0}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

 Finally, we use the Leibnitz rule:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\nabla_{\partial_{t}}\partial_{x} & =\nabla_{\mathbf{e}_{0}}\left(e^{Ht}\mathbf{e}_{1}\right)=\left(\mathbf{e}_{0}\circ e^{Ht}\right)\mathbf{e}_{1}+e^{Ht}\nabla_{\mathbf{e}_{0}}\mathbf{e}_{1}\\
 & =\left(\partial_{t}e^{Ht}\right)e^{-Ht}\partial_{x}=H\partial_{x}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Similarly, we find 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\partial_{t}}\partial_{t}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\partial_{x}}\partial_{x}=He^{2Ht}\partial_{t}$

In the Koszul formula\InsetSpace ~

 If we choose the basis vectors as coordinate derivatives

 (this is the choice usually made in calculations using index notation),
 the terms with commutators will vanish but terms with scalar products will

 At first glance, it is not obvious which choice of basis has more advantages
 in calculations.
 However, it turns out that in many cases calculations are shorter in an

\begin_layout Standard
In the previous section we have seen that the information about Levi-Civita
 connection 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla$
\end_inset

 is carried entirely by the commutators 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathbf{e}_{a},\mathbf{e}_{b}\right]$
\end_inset

 and can thus be recovered without explicitly involving the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 A more elegant (and practically more useful) description of the Levi-Civita
 connection is obtained by considering the dual tetrad 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just as the commutator of vector fields is defined geometrically without
 involving the metric, the exterior differential
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{exterior differential}

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}$
\end_inset

 is a 2-form defined geometrically by
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{d}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})=\mathbf{u}\circ\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}(\mathbf{v})-\mathbf{v}\circ\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}(\mathbf{u})-\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}([\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}]).\]

\end_inset

Substituting the tetrad vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{b}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{c}$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{d}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}(\mathbf{e}_{b},\mathbf{e}_{c})=-\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}([\mathbf{e}_{b},\mathbf{e}_{c}])\equiv-C^{a}{}_{bc}.\]

\end_inset

So the 2-forms 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}$
\end_inset

 carry essentially the same information as the commutators of the tetrad
 vectors.
 Hence, we expect to be able to express the Levi-Civita connection through
 the dual tetrad 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}$
\end_inset

 and its differentials 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}$

 To do this, one uses some clever tricks, which we will now show.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a basis in the dual space, the 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}$
\end_inset

 can be always decomposed as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{d}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{b,c}X^{a}{}_{bc}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{b}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{c}\]

\end_inset

with some coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $X^{a}{}_{bc}=-X^{a}{}_{cb}$
\end_inset

.
 It is easy to see that these coefficients are directly related to 
\begin_inset Formula $C^{a}{}_{bc}$
\end_inset

 (see the following Calculation).

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Solution:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}$
\end_inset

 applied to arbitrary vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
 Decompose 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 through the tetrad and compute 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\left(\textrm{d}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}\right)\circ(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}) & =\left(\textrm{d}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}\right)\circ\left(\sum_{b}u^{b}\mathbf{e}_{b},\sum_{c}v^{c}\mathbf{e}_{c}\right)\\
 & =\sum_{b,c}u^{b}v^{c}\left(\textrm{d}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}\right)\circ(\mathbf{e}_{b},\mathbf{e}_{c})=-\sum_{b,c}C^{a}{}_{bc}u^{b}v^{c}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

On the other hand, 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{b}\equiv\boldsymbol{\theta}^{b}\circ\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v^{c}\equiv\boldsymbol{\theta}^{c}\circ\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

, so
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\left(\sum_{b,c}X^{a}{}_{bc}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{b}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{c}\right)\circ\left(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}\right) & =\sum_{b,c}X^{a}{}_{bc}\left(u^{b}v^{c}-u^{c}v^{b}\right)\\
 & =2\sum_{b,c}X^{a}{}_{bc}u^{b}v^{c}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 are arbitrary vectors, we obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $X^{a}{}_{bc}=-C^{a}{}_{bc}$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Standard
Let us now see how to recover the Levi-Civita connection.
 So far we have the property
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\textrm{d}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{c}=-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{a,b}C_{\: ab}^{c}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{b},\label{eq:dtheta X}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 which shows that the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $C^{c}{}_{ab}$
\end_inset

 can be easily computed by decomposing 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{c}$
\end_inset

 into the basis of 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{b}$
\end_inset

.
 However, according to Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Levi-Civita C0}

\end_inset

), covariant derivatives of vectors involve a certain combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $C^{c}{}_{ab}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\boldsymbol{\theta}_{c}\circ\nabla_{\mathbf{e}_{a}}\mathbf{e}_{b}=\frac{1}{2}\left(C_{c\, ab}-C_{b\, ac}-C_{a\, bc}\right),\]

\end_inset

rather than simply 
\begin_inset Formula $C^{c}{}_{ab}$
\end_inset

.
 (Here and below we freely lower and raise all Latin indices by implicitly
 using the fiducial Minkowski metric 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{ab}$
\end_inset

.) Now we note that the scalar expression 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\theta}^{c}\circ\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{e}_{b}$
\end_inset

 linearly depends on the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 and is thus equal to some 1-form applied to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

.
 Let us 
\emph on
denote
\emph default
 that 1-form by 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\omega}^{c}{}_{b}$
\end_inset

; in other words, by definition, we set
\begin_inset Formula \[
\boldsymbol{\omega}^{c}{}_{b}(\mathbf{u})\equiv\boldsymbol{\theta}^{c}\circ\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{e}_{b}.\]

\end_inset

 Another way to restate the definition is to say that the 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\omega}^{c}{}_{b}$
\end_inset

 satisfies
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{e}_{b}=\sum_{c}\boldsymbol{\omega}^{c}{}_{b}(\mathbf{u})\mathbf{e}_{c}\label{eq:cov diff thru omega}\end{equation}

\end_inset

for any vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

.
 The 1-forms 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\omega}^{c}{}_{b}$
\end_inset

 are called the 
\series bold
connection 1-forms
\series default

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{connection 1-forms}

\end_inset

 or the 
\series bold
spin connection
\series default
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{spin connection}

\end_inset

corresponding to the dual tetrad 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is clear from Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Levi-Civita C0}

\end_inset

) that the 1-forms 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\omega}_{c\, b}$
\end_inset

 (that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\omega}^{c}{}_{b}$
\end_inset

 with the first index lowered) satisfy
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\omega}_{c\, b}\equiv\frac{1}{2}\sum_{a}\left(C_{c\, ab}-C_{b\, ac}-C_{a\, bc}\right)\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}.\label{eq:omega def 1}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 Thus, the connection forms 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\omega}_{c\, b}$
\end_inset

 may be computed straightforwardly from the commutator coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $C^{c}{}_{ab}$
\end_inset

.
 After computing 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\omega}_{c\, b}$
\end_inset

, covariant derivatives of arbitrary vector fields can be expressed as follows,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{e}_{b} & =\sum_{c}\boldsymbol{\omega}^{c}{}_{b}(\mathbf{u})\mathbf{e}_{c},\\
\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{v} & =\sum_{b}\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\left(v^{b}\mathbf{e}_{b}\right)=\sum_{b}\left(\mathbf{u}\circ v^{b}\right)\mathbf{e}_{b}+\sum_{b,c}v^{b}\boldsymbol{\omega}^{c}{}_{b}(\mathbf{u})\mathbf{e}_{c}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

In terms of the components 
\begin_inset Formula $v^{c}$
\end_inset

 of a vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

, we find the formula
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left(\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{v}\right)^{c}\equiv\boldsymbol{\theta}^{c}\circ\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{v}=\mathbf{u}\circ v^{c}+\sum_{b}\boldsymbol{\omega}^{c}{}_{b}(\mathbf{u})v^{b}.\label{eq:cov der vec omega}\end{equation}

\end_inset

It is clear that 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\omega}^{c}{}_{b}$
\end_inset

 play the role of the Christoffel symbols in the formula for the covariant
 derivative.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The formula\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:omega def 1}

\end_inset

) is not necessarily the quickest way to compute 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\omega}_{c\, b}$
\end_inset

.
 Comparing it with Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:dtheta X}

\end_inset

), we notice that it might help to compute the following expression,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\sum_{b}\boldsymbol{\omega}_{c\, b}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{b} & =\frac{1}{2}\sum_{a,b}\left(C_{c\, ab}-C_{b\, ac}-C_{a\, bc}\right)\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{b}\\
 & =\frac{1}{2}\sum_{a,b}C_{c\, ab}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{b}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

(The simplification in the second line happens because the terms symmetric
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $a,b$
\end_inset

 cancel).
 Then we can raise the index 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

, use Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:dtheta X}

\end_inset

), and obtain the following relationship,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\textrm{d}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{c}=-\sum_{b}\boldsymbol{\omega}^{c}{}_{b}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{b}.\label{eq:Cartan 1}\end{equation}

\end_inset

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{Cartan structure equation}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An immediate practical importance of this equation is that it can be used,
 instead of Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:omega def 1}

\end_inset

), to 
\emph on
determine
\emph default
 the 1-forms 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\omega}^{c}{}_{b}$
\end_inset

.
 Of course, Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Cartan 1}

\end_inset

) alone does not specify 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\omega}^{c}{}_{b}$
\end_inset

 uniquely.
 For instance, the 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

-forms 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}\sum_{a}C^{c}{}_{ab}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}$
\end_inset

 are also a solution of Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Cartan 1}

\end_inset

), although these 1-forms do not coincide with 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\omega}^{c}{}_{b}$
\end_inset

.
 More generally, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\omega}^{c}{}_{b}$
\end_inset

 is any solution of Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Cartan 1}

\end_inset

), one may add the following term, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\boldsymbol{\omega}^{c}{}_{b}\rightarrow\boldsymbol{\omega}^{c}{}_{b}+\sum_{a}B^{c}{}_{ab}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a},\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $B^{c}{}_{ab}=B^{c}{}_{ba}$
\end_inset

 is an arbitrary array of coefficients symmetric in 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(a,b\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The new 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\omega}^{c}{}_{b}$
\end_inset

 will still be a solution of Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Cartan 1}

\end_inset

).
 However, in addition to Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Cartan 1}

\end_inset

) the connection 1-forms 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\omega}^{c}{}_{b}$
\end_inset

 must satisfy the antisymmetry requirement,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\omega}_{c\, b}=-\boldsymbol{\omega}_{b\, c},\label{eq:omega antisymmetry}\end{equation}

\end_inset

which can be easily read from Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:omega def 1}

 uniquely, so that one does not need to use Eq.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a two-dimensional spacetime with local coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ t,x\right\} $

\end_inset

 defined as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{e}_{0}=e^{-f(t)}\partial_{t},\quad\mathbf{e}_{1}=e^{-h(t)}\partial_{x},\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $f(t),h(t)$
\end_inset

 are scalar functions depending only on 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 (but not on 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 The task is to compute the connection 1-forms 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{c\, b}$
\end_inset

 and the covariant derivatives 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\partial_{t}}\partial_{x}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\partial_{x}}\partial_{x}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Solution:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The metric corresponding to the given frame field is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g=e^{2f(t)}dt^{2}-e^{2h(t)}dx^{2}.\]

\end_inset

 We begin by defining the dual frame,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\boldsymbol{\theta}^{0}=e^{f(t)}\textrm{d}t,\quad\boldsymbol{\theta}^{1}=e^{h(t)}\textrm{d}x,\]

\end_inset

and the differentials,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{d}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{0}=0,\quad\textrm{d}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{1}=\dot{h}e^{h(t)}\textrm{d}t\wedge\textrm{d}x=-\dot{h}e^{h(t)-f(t)}\textrm{d}x\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{0},\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{h}\equiv\partial_{t}h(t)$
\end_inset

.
 Note that we intentionally wrote 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{1}$
\end_inset

 in the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(...\right)\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{0}$
\end_inset

 rather than 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(...\right)\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{1}$
\end_inset

, trying to satisfy the antisymmetry property\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:omega antisymmetry}

\end_inset

) which entails 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\omega}^{0}{}_{0}=\boldsymbol{\omega}^{1}{}_{1}=0$
\end_inset

.
 Then we can 
\emph on
try to guess
\emph default
 a solution 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\boldsymbol{\omega}}^{c}{}_{b}$
\end_inset

 of Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Cartan 1}

\end_inset

) as follows,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tilde{\boldsymbol{\omega}}^{0}{}_{0}=\tilde{\boldsymbol{\omega}}^{0}{}_{1}=0,\quad\tilde{\boldsymbol{\omega}}^{1}{}_{0}=\dot{h}e^{h(t)-f(t)}\textrm{d}x,\quad\tilde{\boldsymbol{\omega}}^{1}{}_{1}=0.\]

\end_inset

Despite our efforts, the 1-forms 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\boldsymbol{\omega}}^{a}{}_{b}$
\end_inset

 are not yet the correct connection forms because they do not satisfy the
 antisymmetry property\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:omega antisymmetry}

\end_inset

).
 To correct this, we may add a multiple of 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{0}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\boldsymbol{\omega}}^{1}{}_{0}$
\end_inset

 and a multiple of 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{1}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\boldsymbol{\omega}}^{0}{}_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 Presently, it is clear that we only need to add 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{h}e^{h(t)-f(t)}\textrm{d}x$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\boldsymbol{\omega}}^{0}{}_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 So the correct set of the connection 1-forms is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\boldsymbol{\omega}^{0}{}_{1}=\boldsymbol{\omega}_{0\,1}=-\boldsymbol{\omega}_{1\,0}=\boldsymbol{\omega}^{1}{}_{0}=\dot{h}e^{h(t)-f(t)}\textrm{d}x.\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The covariant derivatives are now computed using the formula\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:cov der vec omega}

\end_inset

).
 Consider the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}=\partial_{x}=e^{h(t)}\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 In the orthonormal frame 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1}\right\} $
\end_inset

 the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 has a single nonzero component, 
\begin_inset Formula $v^{1}=e^{h(t)}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:cov der vec omega}

\end_inset

) is rewritten as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{v}\right)^{c}=\mathbf{u}\circ v^{c}+\boldsymbol{\omega}^{c}{}_{1}(\mathbf{u})v^{1}.\]

\end_inset

A direct evaluation of components yields
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\left(\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{v}\right)^{0} & =\boldsymbol{\omega}^{0}{}_{1}(\mathbf{u})e^{h(t)}=\dot{h}e^{2h(t)-f(t)}\mathbf{u}\circ x,\\
\left(\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{v}\right)^{1} & =\mathbf{u}\circ e^{h(t)}=\dot{h}e^{h(t)}\mathbf{u}\circ t.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Therefore, for arbitrary 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{v}=\dot{h}e^{h(t)}\left\{ e^{h(t)-f(t)}\left(\mathbf{u}\circ x\right)\mathbf{e}_{0}+\left(\mathbf{u}\circ t\right)\mathbf{e}_{1}\right\} .\]

\end_inset

Substituting 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}=\partial_{t}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}=\partial_{x}$
\end_inset

, we find 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\nabla_{\partial_{t}}\partial_{x} & =\dot{h}e^{h(t)}\mathbf{e}_{1}=\dot{h}\partial_{x};\\
\nabla_{\partial_{x}}\partial_{x} & =\dot{h}e^{2h(t)-f(t)}\mathbf{e}_{0}=\dot{h}e^{2h(t)-2f(t)}\partial_{t}.\end{align*}

 By definition\InsetSpace ~

where the hat over 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\mathbf{v}}_{j}$

 means that the

 Since the

\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}

Hence,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}

After developing powerful techniques for manipulating the orthonormal frames,

 To make the notation more concise, I will now adopt the Einstein summation
 convention for the frame indices; for instance, I will now write

 (In Sec.\InsetSpace ~

 I did not use the Einstein summation convention but wrote all summations
 explicitly, to make the presentation more clear.) The frame indices are

Assuming that

\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}}\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}=0$
\end_inset

 Suppose that an orthonormal frame 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\omega}_{a\, b}$

 We would like to determine the unknown functions 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x^{\mu}(\tau)\right\} $
\end_inset

 The tangent vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}$
\end_inset

 can be expressed as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}=u^{a}\mathbf{e}_{a},\quad u^{a}\equiv\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}\circ\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}.\]

\end_inset

The coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{a}$
\end_inset

 will be particular expressions involving 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\mu}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{x}^{\mu}(\tau)$
\end_inset

.
 Then we use Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:cov diff thru omega}

\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\nabla_{\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}}\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}} & =\nabla_{\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}}\left(u^{a}\mathbf{e}_{a}\right)\\

 & =\left(\nabla_{\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}}u^{a}+u^{b}\boldsymbol{\omega}^{a}{}_{b}\circ\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}\right)\mathbf{e}_{a}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a basis, we obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $n$

 equations
\begin_inset Formula \[
\nabla_{\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}}u^{a}+\sum_{b}u^{b}\boldsymbol{\omega}^{a}{}_{b}\circ\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}=0,\quad a=1,...,n.\]

\end_inset

These equations are second-order in derivatives of 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\mu}(\tau)$
\end_inset

, because 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{a}$
\end_inset

 contains 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{x}^{\mu}$

\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}}u^{a}$

\begin_inset Formula $g(\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}},\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}})=\textrm{const}$

 geodesic equations.
 (The first-order equation 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}},\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}})=\textrm{const}$
\end_inset

 is always a consequence of the second-order geodesic equations.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us determine the geodesic curves in the two-dimensional metric 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g=e^{2f(x)}dt^{2}-e^{2h(x)}dx^{2}.\]

\end_inset

The obvious orthonormal frame consists of the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{0}=e^{-f}\partial_{t}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}=e^{-h}\partial_{x}$
\end_inset

 and the corresponding 1-forms 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\theta}^{0}=e^{f}\textrm{d}t$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\theta}^{1}=e^{h}\textrm{d}x$
\end_inset

.
 According to the geodesic equation\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:geodesic in pure tetrad}

\end_inset

), a curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)\equiv\left\{ t(\tau),x(\tau)\right\} $
\end_inset

 with the tangent vector 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}(\tau)\equiv\left\{ \frac{dt(\tau)}{d\tau},\frac{dx(\tau)}{d\tau}\right\} \equiv\dot{t}(\tau)\partial_{t}+\dot{x}(\tau)\partial_{x}\]

\end_inset

 is geodesic if the following two equations hold,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}\circ\left(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{a}(\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}})\right)+\boldsymbol{\theta}^{b}(\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}})\left(\textrm{d}\boldsymbol{\theta}_{b}\right)\circ\left(\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}},\mathbf{e}_{a}\right)=0,\quad a=0,1.\]

\end_inset

(The overdot denotes 
\begin_inset Formula $d/d\tau$
\end_inset

 everywhere.) Presently, 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{0}=f'e^{f}\textrm{d}x\wedge\textrm{d}t$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{1}=0$
\end_inset

, while
\begin_inset Formula \[
\boldsymbol{\theta}^{0}(\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}})=\boldsymbol{\theta}_{0}(\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}})=e^{f}\dot{t},\quad\boldsymbol{\theta}^{1}(\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}})=-\boldsymbol{\theta}_{1}(\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}})=e^{h}\dot{x},\]

\end_inset

so the two geodesic equations are
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}\circ\left(e^{f}\dot{t}\right)+e^{f}\dot{t}\left(f'e^{f}\textrm{d}x\wedge\textrm{d}t\right)\circ\left(\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}},e^{-f}\partial_{t}\right) & =0,\qquad[a=0]\\
\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}\circ\left(-e^{h}\dot{x}\right)+e^{f}\dot{t}\left(f'e^{f}\textrm{d}x\wedge\textrm{d}t\right)\circ\left(\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}},e^{-h}\partial_{x}\right) & =0.\qquad[a=1]\end{align*}

\end_inset

Simplifying these equations, while keeping in mind that 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}$
\end_inset

 acts on 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{t}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{x}$
\end_inset

 simply as 
\begin_inset Formula $d/d\tau$
\end_inset

, we find
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\ddot{t}+2f'\dot{x}\dot{t} & =0,\qquad[a=0]\\
\ddot{x}+h'\dot{x}^{2}+f'e^{2f-2h}\dot{t}^{2} & =0.\qquad[a=1]\end{align*}

\end_inset

These are second-order equations for a general geodesic curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ t(\tau),x(\tau)\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now use the property 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}},\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}})=\textrm{const}$
\end_inset

 to simplify further calculations.
 To be definite, let us look for timelike geodesics normalized by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g(\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}},\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}})=e^{2f}\dot{t}^{2}-e^{2h}\dot{x}^{2}=1.\]

\end_inset

 Presently it is clear that the equation for 
\begin_inset Formula $x(\tau)$
\end_inset

 contains only 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{t}^{2}$
\end_inset

 and functions of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{x}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, let us substitute 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{t}^{2}$
\end_inset

 through 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{x}^{2}$
\end_inset

 into that equation,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\ddot{x}+h'\dot{x}^{2}+f'e^{-2h}\left(1+e^{2h}\dot{x}^{2}\right)\\
=\ddot{x}+\left(h'+f'\right)\dot{x}^{2}+f'e^{-2h} & =0.\end{align*}

\end_inset

We obtained a closed second-order equation for 
\begin_inset Formula $x(\tau)$
\end_inset

, and we can proceed to solve this equation by standard methods.
 Reducing to the first-order equation by a substitution 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{x}=v(x)$
\end_inset

, we find
\begin_inset Formula \[
vv'+\left(h'+f'\right)v^{2}+f'e^{-2h}=0,\]

\end_inset

where the prime stands for 
\begin_inset Formula $d/dx$
\end_inset

.
 The last equation can be integrated to
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{1}{2}v^{2}e^{2(h+f)}=\frac{1}{2}C^{2}-\frac{1}{2}e^{2f},\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $C^{2}>0$
\end_inset

 is an integration constant.
 Finally, the solution of the geodesic equation for 
\begin_inset Formula $x(\tau)$
\end_inset

 is expressed in the form of an indefinite integral,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int^{x(\tau)}\frac{dx}{v(x)}=\int^{x(\tau)}\frac{e^{h+f}dx}{\sqrt{C^{2}-e^{2f}}}=\tau-\tau_{0}.\]

\end_inset

Then the solution for 
\begin_inset Formula $t(\tau)$
\end_inset

 can be found by integrating the equation
\begin_inset Formula \[
\dot{t}=e^{-f}\sqrt{1+e^{2h}\dot{x}^{2}}=Ce^{-2f(x(\tau))}.\]

\end_inset

In some cases (for some functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

), these equations can be integrated analytically and the geodesics obtained
 in closed form.

Determining Killing vectors

\begin_layout Standard
A Killing vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{k}$
\end_inset

 satisfies 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{k}}g=0$
\end_inset

 (see Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Killing-vectors}

\end_inset

); a conformal Killing vector satisfies 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{k}}g=2\lambda g$
\end_inset

 (see Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Conformal-Killing-vectors}

\end_inset

).
 Sometimes one would like to determine whether a Killing vector or a conformal
 Killing vector exists for a given metric.
 One can perform the necessary calculations in the vielbein formalism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 can be expressed through the vielbein (see Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Tetrads}

\end_inset

) as
\begin_inset Formula \[
g=\eta_{ab}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}\otimes\boldsymbol{\theta}^{b},\]

\end_inset

while 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{ab}$
\end_inset

 is a constant numeric matrix, we have
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{k}}g=\eta_{ab}\left[\left(\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{k}}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}\right)\otimes\boldsymbol{\theta}^{b}+\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}\otimes\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{k}}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{b}\right].\]

\end_inset

The Lie derivatives 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{k}}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}$
\end_inset

 can be computed easily through the Cartan homotopy formula\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Cartan homotopy formula}

\end_inset

),
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{k}}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}=\textrm{d}\left(\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}\circ\mathbf{k}\right)+\iota_{\mathbf{k}}\textrm{d}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}.\]

\end_inset

Then one can derive the Killing equation easily.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a metric 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g=e^{2f(t)}dt^{2}-e^{2h(t)}dx^{2}.\]

\end_inset

Let us determine whether 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{k}\equiv a(t,x)\partial_{t}+b(t,x)\partial_{x}\]

\end_inset

can be a Killing vector for 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $a(t,x)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b(t,x)$
\end_inset

 are unknown functions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dual frame is
\begin_inset Formula \[
\boldsymbol{\theta}^{0}=e^{f(t)}\textrm{d}t,\quad\boldsymbol{\theta}^{1}=e^{h(t)}\textrm{d}x.\]

\end_inset

The differentials are
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{d}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{0}=0,\quad\textrm{d}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{1}=e^{h}\dot{h}\textrm{d}t\wedge\textrm{d}x.\]

\end_inset

So we compute
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{k}}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{0} & =\textrm{d}\left(\boldsymbol{\theta}^{0}\circ\mathbf{k}\right)+\iota_{\mathbf{k}}\textrm{d}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{0}=\textrm{d}\left(e^{f}a\right),\\
\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{k}}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{1} & =\textrm{d}\left(\boldsymbol{\theta}^{1}\circ\mathbf{k}\right)+\iota_{\mathbf{k}}\textrm{d}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{1}=\textrm{d}\left(e^{h}b\right)+e^{h}\dot{h}\left(a\textrm{d}x-b\textrm{d}t\right).\end{align*}

\end_inset

Note that
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{d}(e^{f}a)=\left(e^{f}a\right)_{,t}\textrm{d}t+\left(e^{f}a\right)_{,x}\textrm{d}x,\]

\end_inset

and similarly for 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}(e^{h}b)$
\end_inset

.
 So the Killing equation, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{k}}g=0$
\end_inset

, becomes
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{k}}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{0}\otimes\boldsymbol{\theta}^{0}+\boldsymbol{\theta}^{0}\otimes\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{k}}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{0}-\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{k}}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{1}\otimes\boldsymbol{\theta}^{1}-\boldsymbol{\theta}^{1}\otimes\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{k}}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{1}=0.\]

\end_inset

This is rewritten (with implied symmetric tensor products) as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
 & \left[\left(e^{f}a\right)_{,t}dt+\left(e^{f}a\right)_{,x}dx\right]e^{f}dt\\
 & \;-\left[\left(e^{h}b\right)_{,t}dt+\left(e^{h}b\right)_{,x}dx+e^{h}\dot{h}\left(adx-bdt\right)\right]e^{h}dx\\
 & =0.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Gathering terms with 
\begin_inset Formula $dt^{2}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $dt\, dx$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $dx^{2}$
\end_inset

, we obtain the equations
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\left(e^{f}a\right)_{,t} & =0,\\
\left(e^{f}a\right)_{,x}e^{f}-\left(e^{h}b\right)_{,t}e^{h}+b\dot{h}e^{2h} & =0,\\
\left(e^{h}b\right)_{,x}+a\dot{h}e^{h} & =0.\end{align*}

\end_inset

These equations can be simplified to
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\left(e^{f}a\right)_{,t} & =0,\\
a_{,x} & =b_{,t}e^{2h-2f},\\
b_{,x} & =-a\dot{h}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

One solution is 
\begin_inset Formula $a=0,b=\textrm{const}$
\end_inset

, which is the obvious Killing vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{k}=\partial_{x}$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $a\neq0$
\end_inset

, we may solve the first equation as 
\begin_inset Formula $a=q(x)e^{-f}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $q\neq0$
\end_inset

, differentiate the second equation by 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, the third equation by 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, and divide by 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 to obtain
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{q_{,xx}}{q}=-e^{2h-2f}\left(\ddot{h}-\dot{h}\dot{f}\right).\]

\end_inset

Since the right-hand side is a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 while the left-hand side is a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, solutions exist only if both sides are equal to a constant.
 Unless the functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f(t),h(t)$
\end_inset

 are such that 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{2h-2f}\left(\ddot{h}-\dot{h}\dot{f}\right)=K=\textrm{const}$
\end_inset

, no other Killing vectors exist besides 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{k}=\partial_{x}$
\end_inset

 Let us denote this matrix by

\begin_layout Subsection
Ricci tensor and Ricci scalar
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Ricci tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{Ric}$
\end_inset

 is defined as the trace of the Riemann tensor,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{Ric}\left(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\right)\equiv\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})}R(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{y}).\]

\end_inset

In the tetrad formulation, the first two arguments of 
\begin_inset Formula $R()$
\end_inset

 are the implicit arguments of the 2-forms 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{R}^{a}{}_{b}$
\end_inset

, so by Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Riemann tetrad def}

\end_inset

) we have
\begin_inset Formula \[
R(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{e}_{b},\mathbf{y})\equiv g(R(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{x})\mathbf{e}_{b},\mathbf{y})=g(\mathbf{e}_{a},\mathbf{y})\boldsymbol{R}^{a}{}_{b}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{x}).\]

\end_inset

We can use the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

 to compute the trace:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\textrm{Ric}\left(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{e}_{b}\right) & =\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})}R(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{e}_{b},\mathbf{y})=R(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{e}^{c},\mathbf{e}_{b},\mathbf{e}_{c})\\
 & =\boldsymbol{R}^{c}{}_{b}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{e}_{c}).\end{align*}

\end_inset

Therefore, the Ricci tensor is adequately described by the set of 1-forms
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\textrm{Ric}_{b} & \equiv-\iota_{\mathbf{e}_{c}}\boldsymbol{R}^{c}{}_{b}=\iota_{\mathbf{e}^{c}}\boldsymbol{R}_{b\, c};\\
\textrm{Ric}\left(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\right) & =\boldsymbol{\theta}^{b}(\mathbf{y})\iota_{\mathbf{x}}\textrm{Ric}_{b}=\iota_{\mathbf{x}}g(\mathbf{e}^{b},\mathbf{y})\textrm{Ric}_{b}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Here it is important to recall that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}^{b}$
\end_inset

 differs from 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{b}$
\end_inset

 and is defined by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}^{b}\equiv\eta^{ab}\mathbf{e}_{a}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly, the Ricci scalar is computed as the trace
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
R=\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})}\textrm{Ric}\left(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\right)=\iota_{\mathbf{e}^{b}}\textrm{Ric}_{b}=R_{a\, b}\left(\mathbf{e}^{b},\mathbf{e}^{a}\right).\label{eq:R as trace of Rab}\end{equation}

\end_inset

These equations offer an efficient method for practical calculations with
 the Ricci tensor and scalar.

Let us denote by

 Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\omega}_{a\, b}$
\end_inset

 are the connection 1-forms for the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 We now need to compute the modified connection forms 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\boldsymbol{\omega}}_{a\, b}$
\end_inset

.
 After that, the modified Riemann and Ricci tensors will be determined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The connection forms 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\boldsymbol{\omega}}_{a\, b}$
\end_inset

 are found using the first Cartan structure equation\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Cartan 1}

\end_inset

):
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\textrm{d}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{c} & =-\boldsymbol{\omega}^{c}{}_{b}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{b},\\
\textrm{d}\left(e^{\lambda}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{c}\right) & =-\tilde{\boldsymbol{\omega}}^{c}{}_{b}\wedge e^{\lambda}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{b}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

It follows that
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\textrm{d}\lambda\right)\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}_{c}=-\left(\tilde{\boldsymbol{\omega}}_{c\, b}-\boldsymbol{\omega}_{c\, b}\right)\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{b}.\]

\end_inset

We can now use Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:formula for chi without components 2}

\end_inset

) to express the 1-forms 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\delta\tilde{\boldsymbol{\omega}}_{c\, b}\equiv\tilde{\boldsymbol{\omega}}_{c\, b}-\boldsymbol{\omega}_{c\, b}\]

\end_inset

 explicitly through 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\lambda$

\begin_inset Formula \[
\delta\boldsymbol{\omega}_{a\, b}=\iota_{\mathbf{e}_{b}}\left(\textrm{d}\lambda\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}_{a}\right)-\iota_{\mathbf{e}_{a}}\left(\textrm{d}\lambda\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}_{b}\right)-\frac{1}{2}\iota_{\mathbf{e}_{b}}\iota_{\mathbf{e}_{a}}\left(\boldsymbol{\theta}^{c}\wedge\textrm{d}\lambda\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}_{c}\right).\]

\end_inset

The last term vanishes since 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\theta}^{c}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}_{c}=0$
\end_inset

, and after a simplification,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\iota_{\mathbf{e}_{b}}\left(\textrm{d}\lambda\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}_{a}\right)=\iota_{\mathbf{e}_{b}}\left(\textrm{d}\lambda\right)\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}_{a}-\left(\textrm{d}\lambda\right)\eta_{ab}=\left(\mathbf{e}_{b}\circ\lambda\right)\boldsymbol{\theta}_{a}-\eta_{ab}\textrm{d}\lambda,\]

\end_inset

 we find
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\delta\boldsymbol{\omega}_{a\, b}=\left(\mathbf{e}_{b}\circ\lambda\right)\boldsymbol{\theta}_{a}-\left(\mathbf{e}_{a}\circ\lambda\right)\boldsymbol{\theta}_{b}.\label{eq:delta omega tetrads}\end{equation}

\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\omega}_{a\, b}$
\end_inset

 via the second Cartan structure equation\InsetSpace ~

\end_inset

).
 Hence, the curvature 2-forms 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\boldsymbol{R}}_{a\, b}$
\end_inset

 for the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{g}$
\end_inset

 are related to the 2-forms

\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}

\begin_inset Formula $\delta\boldsymbol{\omega}_{a\, b}$
\end_inset

 from Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:delta omega tetrads}

 The individual terms can be rewritten as follows,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{d}\delta\boldsymbol{\omega}_{a\, b}=\left(\textrm{d}\left(\mathbf{e}_{b}\circ\lambda\right)\right)\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}_{a}+\left(\mathbf{e}_{b}\circ\lambda\right)\textrm{d}\boldsymbol{\theta}_{a}-\left[_{a\leftrightarrow b}\right],\]

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\left[_{a\leftrightarrow b}\right]$
\end_inset

 the repetition of previous terms with the indices 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 interchanged.
 Further, we use the first Cartan structure equation to simplify
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\delta\boldsymbol{\omega}_{a\, c}\wedge\boldsymbol{\omega}^{c}{}_{b} & =\left(\mathbf{e}_{c}\circ\lambda\right)\boldsymbol{\theta}_{a}\wedge\boldsymbol{\omega}^{c}{}_{b}-\left(\mathbf{e}_{a}\circ\lambda\right)\boldsymbol{\theta}_{c}\wedge\boldsymbol{\omega}^{c}{}_{b}\\

\end_inset

Using the identities
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\left(\mathbf{e}_{c}\circ\lambda\right)\boldsymbol{\theta}^{c} & =\boldsymbol{\theta}^{c}\iota_{\mathbf{e}_{c}}\left(\textrm{d}\lambda\right)=\textrm{d}\lambda,\\
\left(\mathbf{e}_{c}\circ\lambda\right)\left(\mathbf{e}^{c}\circ\lambda\right) & =\textrm{Tr}_{(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})}\left(\iota_{\mathbf{a}}\textrm{d}\lambda\right)\left(\iota_{\mathbf{b}}\textrm{d}\lambda\right)=g^{-1}\left(\textrm{d}\lambda,\textrm{d}\lambda\right),\\
\boldsymbol{\theta}^{c}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}_{c} & =0,\end{align*}

\end_inset

 (the first line above follows from Statement\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Statement-decomposition of form}

\end_inset

), we find
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
 & \delta\boldsymbol{\omega}_{a\, c}\wedge\delta\boldsymbol{\omega}^{c}{}_{b}\\
 & =\left(\left(\mathbf{e}_{c}\circ\lambda\right)\boldsymbol{\theta}_{a}-\left(\mathbf{e}_{a}\circ\lambda\right)\boldsymbol{\theta}_{c}\right)\wedge\left(\left(\mathbf{e}_{b}\circ\lambda\right)\boldsymbol{\theta}^{c}-\left(\mathbf{e}^{c}\circ\lambda\right)\boldsymbol{\theta}_{b}\right)\\

\end_inset

Putting the terms together and simplifying, we obtain
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
\tilde{\boldsymbol{R}}_{a\, b} & =\boldsymbol{R}_{a\, b}+\left(\textrm{d}\left(\mathbf{e}_{b}\circ\lambda\right)\right)\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}_{a}-\left(\textrm{d}\left(\mathbf{e}_{a}\circ\lambda\right)\right)\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}_{b}\nonumber \\

 of the function

 The Hessian is a symmetric bilinear form defined by the equivalent formulas
\begin_inset Formula \[

\end_inset

It follows from the definition that 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{\lambda}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})$
\end_inset

 contains only derivatives of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$

 and of the metric, but no derivatives of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is a given function, we may assume that the Hessian 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 is a known tensor.
 We can now express the terms 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\left(\mathbf{e}_{b}\circ\lambda\right)$
\end_inset

 through the Hessian.
 First, we use the Leibnitz rule for the derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}$
\end_inset

 of a 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}\lambda$
\end_inset

 applied to a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}$

\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\left[\left(\textrm{d}\lambda\right)\circ\mathbf{b}\right] & =\left(\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\textrm{d}\lambda\right)\circ\mathbf{b}+\left(\textrm{d}\lambda\right)\circ\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{b}\\
 & =H_{\lambda}\left(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\right)+\left(\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{b}\right)\circ\lambda.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Substituting the basis vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}=\mathbf{e}_{a}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}=\mathbf{e}_{b}$
\end_inset

, we find
\begin_inset Formula \[
\nabla_{\mathbf{e}_{a}}\left[\left(\textrm{d}\lambda\right)\circ\mathbf{e}_{b}\right]=\iota_{\mathbf{e}_{a}}\textrm{d}\left(\mathbf{e}_{b}\circ\lambda\right)=H_{\lambda}\left(\mathbf{e}_{a},\mathbf{e}_{b}\right)+\left(\nabla_{\mathbf{e}_{a}}\mathbf{e}_{b}\right)\circ\lambda.\]

\end_inset

Using Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:cov diff thru omega}

\end_inset

), we can express 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{e}_{a}}\mathbf{e}_{b}$
\end_inset

 through the connection 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\omega}_{a\, b}$
\end_inset

 and obtain
\begin_inset Formula \[
\iota_{\mathbf{e}_{a}}\textrm{d}\left(\mathbf{e}_{b}\circ\lambda\right)=\iota_{\mathbf{e}_{a}}\iota_{\mathbf{e}_{b}}H_{\lambda}+\iota_{\mathbf{e}_{a}}\sum_{c}\boldsymbol{\omega}^{c}{}_{b}\left(\mathbf{e}_{c}\circ\lambda\right).\]

\end_inset

By dropping the insertion 
\begin_inset Formula $\iota_{\mathbf{e}_{a}}$
\end_inset

 of the arbitrary basis vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{a}$
\end_inset

, we can rewrite the above as an equality of 1-forms,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{d}\left(\mathbf{e}_{b}\circ\lambda\right)=\iota_{\mathbf{e}_{b}}H_{\lambda}+\boldsymbol{\omega}^{c}{}_{b}\left(\mathbf{e}_{c}\circ\lambda\right).\]

\end_inset

This relationship is now used to simplify Eq.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
\tilde{\boldsymbol{R}}_{a\, b} & =\boldsymbol{R}_{a\, b}+\left(\iota_{\mathbf{e}_{b}}H_{\lambda}\right)\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}_{a}-\left(\iota_{\mathbf{e}_{a}}H_{\lambda}\right)\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}_{b}\nonumber \\

\end_inset

The following auxiliary calculations are helpful,

where 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is the dimension of the spacetime,
\begin_inset Formula \[

Einstein-Hilbert action in tetrads

\begin_layout Standard
The dynamics of General Relativity is described by Einstein equations, which
 are derived from the action principle.
 In Section\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Einstein-Hilbert-action}

\end_inset

 the action was defined as a functional of the metric tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

.
 The metric was treated as a dynamical variable that satisfies certain equations
 of motion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An alternative approach is to regard the tetrad of 1-forms 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

 as the primary dynamical variable.
 The metric tensor can be expressed through 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $g=\sum_{a}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}\otimes\boldsymbol{\theta}_{a}$
\end_inset

.
 However, it is also useful to work directly with the tetrad, without using
 the metric tensor.
 In this section I will explain how the Einstein-Hilbert action is expressed
 and the Einstein equations are derived in the tetrad formalism.

\begin_layout Standard
The standard way of expressing the Einstein-Hilbert action in local coordinates
 is
\begin_inset Formula \[
S_{\text{EH}}=\frac{1}{16\pi G}\int R\sqrt{-g}\textrm{d}^{4}x,\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is the Ricci scalar and 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 is Newton's constant.
 This formula can be rewritten with help of the volume 4-form,
\begin_inset Formula \[
S_{\text{EH}}=\frac{1}{16\pi G}\int_{\mathcal{M}}R\,\textrm{Vol}.\]

\end_inset

Now we would like to express the 4-form 
\begin_inset Formula $R\,\textrm{Vol}$
\end_inset

 in terms of the tetrad 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 This can be done using the following trick.
 We note that 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is a double trace of the Riemann tensor, and that a multiple trace can
 be seen in Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:omega wedge star omega Tr}

\end_inset

).
 Therefore, it will be possible to express the 4-form 
\begin_inset Formula $R\,\textrm{Vol}$
\end_inset

 directly through the curvature 2-forms.
 Using Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:R as trace of Rab}

\end_inset

) and Statement\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Statement-hodge-symmetric}

\end_inset

(d), we find
\begin_inset Formula \[
R\,\textrm{Vol}=R_{a\, b}(\mathbf{e}^{b},\mathbf{e}^{a})\,\textrm{Vol}=R_{a\, b}\wedge*(\boldsymbol{\theta}^{b}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}).\]

\end_inset

Using the relationship (see Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Hodge-duality}

\end_inset

)
\begin_inset Formula \[
*(\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{b})=\frac{1}{2!}\varepsilon^{abcd}\boldsymbol{\theta}_{c}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}_{d},\]

\end_inset

we obtain
\begin_inset Formula \[
R\,\textrm{Vol}=-\frac{1}{2}\varepsilon^{abcd}R_{a\, b}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}_{c}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}_{d}.\]

\end_inset

Hence, the Einstein-Hilbert action can be rewritten as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
S_{\text{EH}} & =\frac{1}{16\pi G}\int_{\mathcal{M}}R_{a\, b}\wedge*\left(\boldsymbol{\theta}^{b}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a}\right)\\
 & =-\frac{1}{32\pi G}\int_{\mathcal{M}}\varepsilon^{abcd}R_{a\, b}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}_{c}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}_{d}.\end{align*}

\begin_layout Standard
The reason we need to consider more general vector bundles than 
\begin_inset Formula $T\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 is that it is convenient to represent physical fields in (classical) field
 theory as sections of vector bundles.
 Fields are usually vector-valued (or tensor-valued) functions of spacetime,
 e.g.\InsetSpace ~
a Dirac spinor 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{Dirac spinor}

\end_inset

field 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 represents particles of spin 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 and has values in a four-dimensional complex vector space.
 When we represent a field by a section of a vector bundle, the spacetime
 is the base manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 and the value of the field at a point belongs to some vector space which
 is the fiber at that point.
 For example, spinor fields 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi(p)$
\end_inset

 can be thought of as sections of a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

spinor bundle
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with fibers 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{C}^{4}$
\end_inset

; tensor fields 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{\mu\nu}(p)$
\end_inset

 are sections of a vector bundle with the fibers 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{p}\mathcal{M}\otimes T_{p}\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

.
 Vector bundles give us a mathematical construction that describes all the
 physical fields in a unified language.

For example, consider the tangent bundle

 The existence of such a map would imply that the image of a fixed nonzero

Consider a sphere 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{2n}$

 of radius 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 embedded in an (
\begin_inset Formula $n+1$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{2n+1}$
\end_inset

, so that every point 
\begin_inset Formula $p\in S^{2n}$
\end_inset

 is represented as 
\begin_inset Formula $p=\left\{ x_{1},...,x_{2n+1}\right\} $
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{j=1}^{2n+1}x_{j}^{2}=R^{2}$

.
 The parity symmetry, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\rightarrow-\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

, in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{2n+1}$
\end_inset

, generates a map 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{P}:S^{2n}\rightarrow S^{2n}$
\end_inset

, bringing every point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 to the opposite point 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{P}p$
\end_inset

.
 Suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is an everywhere nonzero, smooth tangent vector field; we shall obtain
 a contradiction from this assumption.
 From each point 
\begin_inset Formula $p\in S^{2n}$
\end_inset

, we can emit a geodesic in the direction 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, for every point 
\begin_inset Formula $p\in S^{2n}$
\end_inset

 we have a geodesic curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau;p)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 is the proper length along the curve, measured from 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(0;p)=p$
\end_inset

.
 Note that every geodesic on a sphere is an arc of great circle, and the
 circumference of every great circle is 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi R$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau;p)$
\end_inset

 reaches the opposite point 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{P}p$
\end_inset

 when we extend it until 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=\pi R$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\pi R;p)=\hat{P}p$
\end_inset

.
 Since by assumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is a smooth field, the map 
\begin_inset Formula $p\rightarrow\gamma(\tau;p)$
\end_inset

 is a smooth map 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{2n}\rightarrow S^{2n}$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, the map 
\begin_inset Formula $p\rightarrow\gamma(\tau;p)$
\end_inset

 smoothly interpolates between the identity map and the parity inversion
 map 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{P}$
\end_inset

, as 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 changes between 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi R$
\end_inset

.
 However, the space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{2n+1}$
\end_inset

 is odd-dimensional, so the parity inversion 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{P}$
\end_inset

 changes the orientation of the sphere; more precisely, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},...,\mathbf{e}_{2n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a basis of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(TS^{2n}\right)_{p}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 is the radial vector representing 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{x},\mathbf{e}_{1},...,\mathbf{e}_{2n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a basis of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{2n+1}$
\end_inset

 whose orientation is reversed under 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{P}$
\end_inset

.
 It is impossible to smoothly deform the identity map 
\begin_inset Formula $p\rightarrow p$
\end_inset

, which does not change the orientation, into the parity inversion map 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{P}$
\end_inset

, which reverses the orientation.
 Therefore the vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 does not exist.
 // This is taken from Husemoller, Fiber bundles.
 However, I don't really understand how to make this proof watertight.
 Why doesn't it work for just one neighborhood of one point? But surely
 we have vector fields in a neighborhood of a point.

Consider a stereographic projection of the sphere 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{2}$
\end_inset

 onto a plane.
 The sphere is realized as the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \left(x,y,z\right):x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=R^{2}\right\} $
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

, and the projection is described explicitly by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(x,y,z\right)\rightarrow\frac{x+iy}{R-z}\equiv\zeta,\]

\end_inset

where the plane is parametrized by a single complex coordinate 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta$
\end_inset

.
 It is clear that the north pole 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(0,0,R\right)$
\end_inset

 is mapped onto infinity,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\lim_{x,y\rightarrow0}\frac{x+iy}{R-\sqrt{R^{2}-x^{2}-y^{2}}}=\infty,\]

\end_inset

while the south pole 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(0,0,-R\right)$
\end_inset

 is mapped onto 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta=0$
\end_inset

 (the center of the plane).
 Suppose we have a smooth and everywhere nonzero vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 on the sphere; then the image of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 under the projection is a smooth, everywhere nonzero vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{v}}$
\end_inset

 on the plane.
 By the smoothness assumption, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is almost constant and nonzero in a sufficiently small neighborhood of
 the north pole.
 We may trace the direction of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 around a small closed contour 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 surrounding the pole, and compute the accumulated angle swept by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
 This accumulated angle will be zero since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is almost constant.
 However, after the stereographic projection the small contour 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 will become a large closed contour 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{1}$
\end_inset

 on the plane.
 Since the interior of 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 on the sphere will be mapped to the exterior of 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{1}$
\end_inset

 on the plane, the direction of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is mirrored and the angle swept by 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{v}}$
\end_inset

 when traced around 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\gamma}$
\end_inset

 will be 
\begin_inset Formula $4\pi$
\end_inset

.
 However, the contour 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{1}$
\end_inset

 can be continuously deformed into a small contour 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{2}$
\end_inset

 surrounding the center 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta=0$
\end_inset

 of the plane.
 The angle swept by 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{v}}$
\end_inset

 around 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{2}$
\end_inset

 is zero since 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{v}}$
\end_inset

 must be approximately constant in a sufficiently small neighborhood of
 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta=0$
\end_inset

.
 However, the angle swept by a vector field around a closed contour is always
 an integer multiple of 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi$
\end_inset

 and hence must remain constant if 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\gamma}$
\end_inset

 is deformed continuously and if 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{v}}$
\end_inset

 is smooth and everywhere nonzero.
 Thus the angle swept by 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{v}}$
\end_inset

 around 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{1}$
\end_inset

 is zero and cannot be equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $4\pi$
\end_inset

.
 This gives a contradiction.
 Therefore, either the vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is not smooth around the poles (invalidating the first step of the proof),
 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 goes to zero or is non-smooth at another point, which makes the accumulated
 angle jump discontinuously from 
\begin_inset Formula $4\pi$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 during the deformation of the contours 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{1}\rightarrow\gamma_{2}$

 Namely, a certain Lie group 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 is acting in each fiber, such that the equations of the theory are invariant
 under local transformations of the group.
 For example, the gauge group 
\begin_inset Formula $G$

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $U(1)$
\end_inset

 for electromagnetism, 
\begin_inset Formula $SU(2)$

\begin_layout Standard
Let us try to see if the tangent bundle 
\begin_inset Formula $T\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 The gauge group in that case would be the orthogonal group 
\begin_inset Formula $SO(n)$
\end_inset

 that acts fiber-wise, preserving the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 in each fiber.
 (For a metric with the Lorentzian signature, the group will be 
\begin_inset Formula $SO(3,1)$
\end_inset

, called also the 
\series bold
Lorentz group
\series default
.) The connection 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 is then required to give a transformation which is one of the transformations
 from the representation of the Lie algebra 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathfrak{so}(n)$
\end_inset

, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
for any vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 the transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma(\mathbf{v})$
\end_inset

 must be an antisymmetric linear transformation such that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g(\Gamma(\mathbf{v})\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})+g(\mathbf{x},\Gamma(\mathbf{v})\mathbf{y})=0.\]

\end_inset

It is easy to see that this condition coincides with the condition\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:compatibility with the metric}

\begin_inset Formula $\nabla=\partial+\Gamma$
\end_inset

 with the metric.
 Therefore the statement that the connection 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla$
\end_inset

 on the tangent bundle comes from the orthogonal gauge group is the same
 as the assumption of the compatibility of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla$
\end_inset

 with the metric.
 This is just one example of how physical assumptions can be expressed in
 the language of gauge groups.

 The necessity to introduce spinors became apparent only after the development
 of quantum mechanics: It turned out that particles such as electrons or
 quarks must be described by spinor-valued fields, rather than by vector
 or tensor-valued fields.
 Below I shall explain the motivation for introducing spinors in more detail.
 Right now, I only give a rough heuristic picture.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Vectors can be visualized as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

directed magnitudes,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which literally means a direction along a curve leading from a point of
 the manifold to a neighbor point.
 Tensors are defined algebraically through vectors.
 Every tensor remains unchanged under a rotation by 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi$
\end_inset

 because every point returns to its original place, and tensors are defined
 through directions between points.
 Now, it turns out that one can define a special kind of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

directed magnitude
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 called a spinor that remains unchanged only under a 
\begin_inset Formula $4\pi$

 rotation but

 under a 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi$

 rotation.
 Clearly, such an object cannot be a vector or a tensor, or any other object
 defined through points of a manifold, because every point in the neighborhood
 of a given center of rotation will return to its initial position after
 a 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi$
\end_inset

 rotation.
 Thus, a spinor cannot be defined through vectors of the tangent space.
 Spinors belong to some auxiliary vector space in which the rotation group
 acts in a special way.
 To understand how a rotation can act in such an unusual way, we need to
 study the rotation group in some more detail.

 I will now show how quaternions describe rotations, and I will also use
 quaternions to define spinors.
 (In brief: The four-dimensional space of quaternions is equivalent to the
 complex two-dimensional spinor space).
 Let us now briefly explore the properties of quaternions.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The multiplication of quaternions will be defined once we define the multiplicat
ion of the quaternionic units.
 The quaternionic units obey, by definition, the multiplication rules that
 can be written concisely as follows:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mathbf{h}_{1}*\mathbf{h}_{1}=\mathbf{h}_{2}*\mathbf{h}_{2}=\mathbf{h}_{3}*\mathbf{h}_{3}=\mathbf{h}_{1}*\mathbf{h}_{2}*\mathbf{h}_{3}=-\mathbf{1}.\label{eq:Hamilton rule}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 It can be derived from these multiplication rules that
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mathbf{h}_{j}*\mathbf{h}_{k}=-\delta_{jk}\mathbf{1}+\sum_{l=1}^{3}\varepsilon_{jkl}\mathbf{h}_{l},\label{eq:hj hk rule}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$

 is the Kronecker symbol and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{jkl}$
\end_inset

 is the coordinate representation of the three-dimensional Levi-Civita symbol,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{123}=1$
\end_inset

.
 In particular,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{h}_{1}*\mathbf{h}_{2}=\mathbf{h}_{3}=-\mathbf{h}_{2}*\mathbf{h}_{1}.\]

\end_inset

With these definitions, the quaternionic space

\end_inset

Consider the expression 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{h}_{3}*\mathbf{h}_{1}*\mathbf{h}_{2}*\mathbf{h}_{3}=-\mathbf{h}_{3}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{h}_{3}*\mathbf{h}_{1}=\mathbf{h}_{2}$

 All other required relations are obtained in a similar way.

 We use the multiplication rule (

 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mathbf{x}}=x_{0}\mathbf{1}-\vec{x}$
\end_inset

, it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}*\bar{\mathbf{x}}=\left|\mathbf{x}\right|^{2}\mathbf{1}$
\end_inset

.
 The property 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\mathbf{x}*\mathbf{y}\right|^{2}=\left|\mathbf{x}\right|^{2}\left|\mathbf{y}\right|^{2}$
\end_inset

 is straightforward to derive, recalling that the vector product 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{x}\times\vec{y}$
\end_inset

 is orthogonal to both 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{x}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{y}$

\begin_inset Formula $\left|\vec{x}\times\vec{y}\right|^{2}=\left|\vec{x}\right|^{2}\left|\vec{y}\right|^{2}-\left|\vec{x}\cdot\vec{y}\right|^{2}$

The quaternionic multiplication law also admits a representation in terms

\sigma_{j} & \sigma_{k}=\delta_{jk}+\text{i}\sum_{l=1}^{3}\varepsilon_{jkl}\sigma_{l},\end{align*}

\end_inset

is very similar to the multiplication rule of the quaternionic units 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{h}_{j}$
\end_inset

, except for the extra factors of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore a representation for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{h}_{j}$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times2$
\end_inset

 complex matrices may be found as 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\mathbf{h}}_{j}=-\text{i}\sigma_{j}$

\begin_inset Formula $j=1,2,3$
\end_inset

, assuming (naturally) that the identity matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{1}$
\end_inset

 is used for the quaternion 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{1}$
\end_inset

 The general quaternion 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}=a_{0}\mathbf{1}+\sum_{j=1}^{3}a_{j}\mathbf{h}_{j}$
\end_inset

 will be represented by the matrix
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\hat{\mathbf{a}}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}

-\text{i}a_{1}+a_{2} & a_{0}+\text{i}a_{3}\end{array}\right).\label{eq:quaternions by Pauli}\end{equation}

\end_inset

Note that the determinant of this matrix is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\mathbf{a}\right|^{2}$
\end_inset

, and that the Hermitian conjugate matrix corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mathbf{a}}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula \[
\det\hat{\mathbf{a}}=\left|\mathbf{a}\right|^{2}=a_{0}^{2}+a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+a_{3}^{2};\quad\hat{\mathbf{a}}^{\dagger}=\hat{\bar{\mathbf{a}}}.\]

\end_inset

\begin_layout Paragraph
Remark:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As an additional motivation, it is helpful to derive a matrix representation
 of quaternions without guessing the Pauli matrices.
 The four-dimensional space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{H}$
\end_inset

 of quaternions can be interpreted as a two-dimensional 
\emph on
complex
\emph default
 vector space if we somehow define what it means to multiply a quaternion
 by a complex number,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\lambda+\text{i}\mu\right)\mathbf{a}=???\]

\end_inset

 Clearly, it is sufficient to define the multiplication by 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{i}$
\end_inset

, and we need to imitate the property 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{i}^{2}=-1$
\end_inset

.
 Since any of the unit quaternions 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{h}_{j}$
\end_inset

 satisfies 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{h}_{j}^{2}=-\mathbf{1}$
\end_inset

, we may choose for instance 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{h}_{1}$
\end_inset

 as the representative of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{i}$
\end_inset

, so then we define
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\lambda+\text{i}\mu\right)\mathbf{a}\equiv\lambda\mathbf{a}+\mu\mathbf{a}*\mathbf{h}_{1}.\]

\end_inset

This is clearly a linear map in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{H}$
\end_inset

 (note that we multiply by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{h}_{1}$
\end_inset

 from the 
\emph on
right
\emph default
).
 We expect that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{H}$
\end_inset

, considered as a complex vector space, will be two-dimensional, so any
 quaternion 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\in\mathbb{H}$
\end_inset

 can be represented as a linear combination of two basis quaternions with
 complex coefficients.
 We may choose, for instance, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{1},\mathbf{h}_{2}\right\} $
\end_inset

 as the basis, since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{h}_{1}$
\end_inset

 is already chosen as the representative of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{i}$
\end_inset

.
 (Different such choices will yield different but algebraically equivalent
 representations.) Then an arbitrary quaternion will be decomposed as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{a}\equiv a_{0}\mathbf{1}+\sum_{j=1}^{3}a_{j}\mathbf{h}_{j}=\left(a_{0}+\text{i}a_{1}\right)\mathbf{1}+\left(a_{2}-\text{i}a_{3}\right)\mathbf{h}_{2}\]

\end_inset

and so can be represented by an array of two complex numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(a_{0}+\text{i}a_{1},a_{2}-\text{i}a_{3}\right)\in\mathbb{C}^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Since the multiplication by a fixed quaternion 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 is a linear transformation of the vector space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{C}^{2}$
\end_inset

, it is natural to represent that transformation by a 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times2$
\end_inset

 complex matrix.
 For example, the transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\rightarrow\mathbf{h}_{3}*\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 will be equivalent to 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\mathbf{h}_{3}*\left(\begin{array}{c}
a_{0}+\text{i}a_{1}\\
a_{2}-\text{i}a_{3}\end{array}\right) & =\mathbf{h}_{3}*\left(a_{0}\mathbf{1}+a_{1}\mathbf{h}_{1}+a_{2}\mathbf{h}_{2}+a_{3}\mathbf{h}_{3}\right)\\
 & =-a_{3}\mathbf{1}-a_{2}\mathbf{h}_{1}+a_{1}\mathbf{h}_{2}+a_{0}\mathbf{h}_{3}\\
 & =\left(\begin{array}{c}
-a_{3}-\text{i}a_{2}\\
a_{1}-\text{i}a_{0}\end{array}\right)\\
 & =\left(\begin{array}{cc}
0 & -\text{i}\\
-\text{i} & 0\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}
a_{0}+\text{i}a_{1}\\
a_{2}-\text{i}a_{3}\end{array}\right),\end{align*}

\end_inset

therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{h}_{3}$
\end_inset

 is represented by the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $-\text{i}\sigma_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly, we find 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{h}_{1}\rightarrow i\sigma_{3}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{h}_{2}\rightarrow-\text{i}\sigma_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 In this way we find a possible representation of quaternions through Pauli
 matrices.
 (This representation is equivalent to the standard one, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{h}_{j}\rightarrow-\text{i}\sigma_{j}$
\end_inset

, after a permutation of the unit quaternions.)

 is a linear operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{S}$
\end_inset

 is such that 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{v},\hat{S}\mathbf{v})=0$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 (that is to say, the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{S}$
\end_inset

 must be antisymmetric with respect to the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

).
 The picture behind this is that of transforming a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{0}$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{v}_{0}\mapsto\mathbf{v}_{0}+\lambda\hat{S}\mathbf{v}_{0},\]

\end_inset

where the formal parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is, heuristically, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

very small
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and describes the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

infinitesimal

 angle of the rotation.
 Given an infinitesimal rotation operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{S}$
\end_inset

, one can obtain the corresponding finite rotation with angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 This is done by considering the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 rotated by angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 as a vector-valued function 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}(\lambda)$
\end_inset

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}(0)=\mathbf{v}_{0}$
\end_inset

, and then writing the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

infinitesimal rotation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{v}(\lambda+\delta\lambda)=\mathbf{v}(\lambda)+\delta\lambda\,\hat{S}\mathbf{v}(\lambda)\]

\end_inset

 in the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\lambda\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

, as the differential equation
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{d}{d\lambda}\mathbf{v}(\lambda)=\hat{S}\mathbf{v}(\lambda),\quad\mathbf{v}(0)=\mathbf{v}_{0}.\]

\end_inset

The solution is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{v}(\lambda)=\exp(\lambda\hat{S})\mathbf{v}_{0}.\]

\begin_layout Standard
Infinitesimal rotations can be represented by quaternionic multiplication
 through the following trick: If 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q}=q_{0}+\vec{q}$
\end_inset

 is a quaternion and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}$
\end_inset

 is a 3-dimensional vector, understood also as a (purely imaginary) quaternion,
 then the quaternionic commutator
\begin_inset Formula \[
[\mathbf{q},\vec{v}]\equiv\mathbf{q}*\vec{v}-\vec{v}*\mathbf{q}=2\vec{q}\times\vec{v}\]

\end_inset

yields a vector that is always orthogonal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus the quaternionic commutator with a fixed quaternion 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q}$
\end_inset

 is an infinitesimal rotation.
 Geometrically, this is a rotation around the axis given by the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{q}$
\end_inset

, since the infinitesimal change of 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}$
\end_inset

 is proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{q}\times\vec{v}$
\end_inset

.
 The factor 2 means that an infinitesimal rotation with parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 corresponds to a physical rotation by angle 
\begin_inset Formula $2\lambda$
\end_inset

.
 The scalar part 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{0}$
\end_inset

 of the quaternion 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q}$
\end_inset

 does not play any role in the commutator; therefore, let us suppose that
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q}$
\end_inset

 is purely imaginary, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q}=\vec{q}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It remains to exponentiate this infinitesimal rotation to a finite rotation.
 This is accomplished with the standard technique for computing the exponential
 of a commutator: If 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{S}\vec{v}=[\mathbf{q},\vec{v}]$
\end_inset

, where the commutator is computed according to the multiplication rules
 of the quaternion algebra, then
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\exp(\lambda\hat{S})\vec{v}=\exp(\lambda\mathbf{q})*\vec{v}*\exp(-\lambda\mathbf{q}),\label{eq:exponential of quaternion commutator}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where now the exponential 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp(\lambda\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 is also to be computed according to the rules of the quaternion algebra.
 (The exponential of a quaternion 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 is defined by the Taylor series,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\exp\mathbf{x}=1+\mathbf{x}+\frac{1}{2!}\mathbf{x}*\mathbf{x}+\frac{1}{3!}\mathbf{x}*\mathbf{x}*\mathbf{x}+...,\]

\end_inset

and it can be shown that this series converges for any quaternion 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

, just like in the case of a matrix exponential.)

Derivation of Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:exponential of quaternion commutator}

\end_inset

):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We introduce the 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

-dependent function 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}(\lambda)$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}$
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset Formula $0)=\vec{v}_{0}$
\end_inset

 and such that the differential equation holds, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{d}{d\lambda}\vec{v}(\lambda)=[\mathbf{q},\vec{v}(\lambda)].\]

\end_inset

We can verify that Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:exponential of quaternion commutator}

\end_inset

) is a solution of this differential equation.
 First, we note that
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{d}{d\lambda}\exp(\lambda\mathbf{q})=\mathbf{q}*\exp(\lambda\mathbf{q})=\exp(\lambda\mathbf{q})*\mathbf{q};\]

\end_inset

here it is essential that the quaternionic multiplication should be used
 in defining the exponential.
 Then we compute
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\frac{d}{d\lambda} & \left(\exp(\lambda\mathbf{q})*\vec{v}_{0}*\exp(-\lambda\mathbf{q})\right)\\
 & =\mathbf{q}*\exp(\lambda\mathbf{q})*\vec{v}_{0}*\exp(-\lambda\mathbf{q})\\
 & \;+\exp(\lambda\mathbf{q})*\vec{v}_{0}*\exp(-\lambda\mathbf{q})*(-\mathbf{q})\\
 & =[\mathbf{q},\exp(\lambda\mathbf{q})*\vec{v}_{0}*\exp(-\lambda\mathbf{q})]\\
 & =[\mathbf{q},\vec{v}(\lambda)].\end{align*}

\end_inset

Since the solution of the differential equation with a given initial condition
 is unique, we find that the formula\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:exponential of quaternion commutator}

\end_inset

) is indeed the solution.

\begin_layout Standard
Since we now need quaternionic exponentiation, let us derive an explicit
 formula for it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Statement: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An explicit formula for the exponential of a purely imaginary quaternion
 is 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\exp(\vec{a})=\mathbf{1}\cos\left|\vec{a}\right|+\frac{\vec{a}}{\left|\vec{a}\right|}\sin\left|\vec{a}\right|,\]

\end_inset

and for the exponential of an arbitrary quaternion is
\begin_inset Formula \[
\exp\left(a_{0}\mathbf{1}+\vec{a}\right)=\mathbf{1}e^{a_{0}}\cos\left|\vec{a}\right|+e^{a_{0}}\frac{\vec{a}}{\left|\vec{a}\right|}\sin\left|\vec{a}\right|.\]

\end_inset

 It follows that every nonzero quaternion 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 is an exponential of some other quaternion 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}\equiv\ln\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

.
 Also, 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 is purely imaginary if 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\mathbf{x}\right|=1$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{a}=\sum_{j=1}^{3}a_{j}\mathbf{h}_{j}$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{a}*\vec{a}=-\left|\vec{a}\right|^{2}\mathbf{1}$
\end_inset

, so we find the same algebraic law as with the complex number 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{i}\left|\vec{a}\right|$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, the same derivation as for the Euler formula
\begin_inset Formula \[
\exp\left(\text{i}a\right)=\cos a+\text{i}\sin a\]

\end_inset

goes through.
 We obtain
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\exp\vec{a} & =\mathbf{1}\cos\left|\vec{a}\right|+\frac{\vec{a}}{\left|\vec{a}\right|}\sin\left|\vec{a}\right|,\\
\exp\left(a_{0}\mathbf{1}+\vec{a}\right) & =e^{a_{0}}\exp\vec{a}=\mathbf{1}e^{a_{0}}\cos\left|\vec{a}\right|+e^{a_{0}}\frac{\vec{a}}{\left|\vec{a}\right|}\sin\left|\vec{a}\right|.\end{align*}

\end_inset

 For an arbitrary 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}=x_{0}\mathbf{1}+\sum_{j=1}^{3}x_{j}\mathbf{h}_{j}$
\end_inset

, we set 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}=\exp(a_{0}\mathbf{1}+\vec{a})$
\end_inset

 and find 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
a_{0} & =\ln\left|\mathbf{x}\right|,\\
\vec{a} & =\frac{x_{1}\mathbf{h}_{1}+x_{2}\mathbf{h}_{2}+x_{3}\mathbf{h}_{3}}{\sqrt{x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+x_{3}^{2}}}\arccos\frac{x_{0}}{\left|\mathbf{x}\right|}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

In the vector notation,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\ln\,(x_{0}+\vec{x})=\ln\sqrt{x_{0}^{2}+\left|\vec{x}\right|^{2}}+\frac{\vec{x}}{\left|\vec{x}\right|}\arccos\frac{x_{0}}{\sqrt{x_{0}^{2}+\left|\vec{x}\right|^{2}}}.\]

\end_inset

We note that the direction of the vector part of 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 is the same as that of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Standard
We have found that the exponential of an infinitesimal rotation is expressed
 by the formula
\begin_inset Formula \[
\vec{v}\mapsto\mathbf{c}*\vec{v}*\mathbf{c}^{-1},\]

\end_inset

where the quaternion 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 is given by
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{c}=\exp(\lambda\vec{q}),\quad\mathbf{c}^{-1}=\exp(-\lambda\vec{q}).\]

\end_inset

 The axis of rotation is given by the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{q}$
\end_inset

, and the angle of rotation is 
\begin_inset Formula $2\lambda$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now consider the linear transformation in the space of quaternions, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{R}_{\mathbf{c}}:\mathbf{x}\mapsto\mathbf{c}*\mathbf{x}*\mathbf{c}^{-1},\]

\end_inset

for an 
\emph on
arbitrary
\emph default
 fixed quaternion 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 We may normalize 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\mathbf{c}\right|=1$
\end_inset

 without changing 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}_{\mathbf{c}}$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\hat{R}_{\mathbf{c}}(\mathbf{x})=\mathbf{c}*\mathbf{x}*\bar{\mathbf{c}}\label{eq:quaternionic SO3}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 and so 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}_{\mathbf{c}}(\bar{\mathbf{x}})=\overline{\hat{R}_{\mathbf{c}}(\mathbf{x})}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus the three-dimensional subspace of purely imaginary quaternions is
 invariant under 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}_{\mathbf{c}}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}_{\mathbf{c}}$
\end_inset

 preserves the magnitude of quaternions,
\begin_inset Formula \[
|\hat{R}_{\mathbf{c}}(\mathbf{x})|=\left|\mathbf{x}\right|.\]

\end_inset

A purely imaginary quaternion 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}=-\bar{\mathbf{x}}$
\end_inset

, interpreted as a 3-vector, is transformed by 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}_{\mathbf{c}}$
\end_inset

 without changing its Euclidean length; thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}_{\mathbf{c}}$
\end_inset

 acts as an 
\emph on
orthogonal
\emph default
 transformation in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

, i.e.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}_{\mathbf{c}}\in O(3)$
\end_inset

.
 Since every quaternion 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\mathbf{c}\right|=1$
\end_inset

 is an exponential of some purely imaginary quaternion 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}=\ln\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

, we have
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{R}_{\mathbf{c}}(\mathbf{x})=\exp\left(\mathbf{b}\right)*\mathbf{x}*\exp\left(-\mathbf{b}\right),\]

\end_inset

and thus we can smoothly deform 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}_{\mathbf{c}}$
\end_inset

 into the identity map by decreasing 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 to zero.
 Since the determinant 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{R}=\pm1$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}\in O(3)$
\end_inset

, we must have 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{R}_{\mathbf{c}}=1$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

, and therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}_{\mathbf{c}}\in SO(3)$
\end_inset

.
 In this way, normalized quaternions represent three-dimensional rotations,
 and multiplication of quaternions corresponds to composition of rotations:
 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}_{\mathbf{a}}\hat{R}_{\mathbf{b}}=\hat{R}_{\mathbf{a}*\mathbf{b}}$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}_{\mathbf{c}}$
\end_inset

 is quadratic in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

, heuristically one may say that the quaternion 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 is a

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 of the rotation

The operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}_{\mathbf{c}}$
\end_inset

 remains the same when we multiply 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$

 by a number.
 Thus, it is possible to restrict to quaternions 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\mathbf{c}\right|=1$

 without loss of generality.
 In that case, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}^{-1}=\bar{\mathbf{c}}$

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{u}$

 Let us define the quaternion 
\begin_inset Formula \[

\end_inset

and write the action of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}_{\mathbf{c}}$

\begin_inset Formula $\vec{x}$
\end_inset

 explicitly as follows: Either 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{x}$
\end_inset

 is parallel to 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{u}$

\begin_inset Formula $\vec{x}=x_{1}\vec{u}$

\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{R}_{\mathbf{c}}\vec{x}=\mathbf{c}*x_{1}\vec{u}*\bar{\mathbf{c}}=\vec{x}\]

\end_inset

because 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 commutes with 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{u}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \vec{u},\vec{v},\vec{w}\right\} $
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\vec{x}=x_{1}\vec{u}+x_{2}\vec{v},\]

\end_inset

that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{x}$
\end_inset

 is a linear combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{u}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}$

 but does not contain 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{w}$
\end_inset

, while 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{w}=\vec{u}\times\vec{v}$
\end_inset

 Then we compute
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\hat{R}_{\mathbf{c}}\vec{x} & =\mathbf{c}*\vec{x}*\bar{\mathbf{c}}\\

 This is not a trivial statement since we have to be able to analyze an

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}$

 We start with the representation of the rotation

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, we note that any linear operator in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

 has a cubic characteristic polynomial and therefore has at least one real
 eigenvalue.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}^{T}\hat{R}=\hat{1}$
\end_inset

, all eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}$
\end_inset

 satisfy 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\lambda\right|^{2}=1$
\end_inset

 Any complex eigenvalues must come in complex conjugate pairs; therefore,
 there is at most one such pair, 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{\pm\text{i}\alpha}$
\end_inset

.
 If there is such a pair, the remaining eigenvalue must be 1 because 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{R}=1$
\end_inset

.
 If there are no complex eigenvalues then all eigenvalues are 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm1$
\end_inset

 and there are only two possibilities: the eigenvalues of the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}$
\end_inset

 are either 
\begin_inset Formula $1,-1,-1$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $1,1,1$

 In other words, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}$
\end_inset

 is either equal to the identity operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{1}$
\end_inset

 or else must have a nondegenerate eigenvalue 1 (with algebraic multiplicity
 1) and two other eigenvalues of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{\pm\text{i}\alpha}$
\end_inset

 with a real 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 Therefore, in any case there exists an eigenvector 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}\vec{v}=\vec{v}$
\end_inset

 Without loss of generality, we may suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\vec{v}\right|=1$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}$

 preserves the scalar product, the 2-dimensional subspace orthogonal to

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}$

 In that subspace, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}$

 acts as a proper orthogonal transformation.
 In two dimensions, all proper orthogonal transformations are rotations

 Therefore,

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}$
\end_inset

 can now be easily found as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}=\exp(\frac{1}{2}\alpha\vec{v})$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{c}=\exp\left(\frac{1}{2}\alpha\vec{v}\right).\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us now show that, for a given rotation, the quaternion 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 is unique up to a sign.
 If two different quaternions 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 generate the same rotation, then
\begin_inset Formula \[
\forall\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{3}\::\:\mathbf{c}*\mathbf{x}*\bar{\mathbf{c}}=\mathbf{b}*\mathbf{x}*\bar{\mathbf{b}}.\]

\end_inset

Multiply on the left by 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mathbf{c}}$
\end_inset

 and on the right by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\forall\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{3}\::\:\mathbf{x}*\mathbf{a}=\mathbf{a}*\mathbf{x},\qquad\mathbf{a}\equiv\bar{\mathbf{c}}*\mathbf{b}.\]

\end_inset

Therefore, the quaternion 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 commutes with all quaternions.
 This is possible only if 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 is a number.
 However, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left|\mathbf{a}\right|^{2}=\left|\mathbf{c}\right|^{2}\left|\mathbf{b}\right|^{2}=1.\]

\end_inset

Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}=\pm\mathbf{1}$
\end_inset

 and so 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}=\pm\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}$
\end_inset

 is a given orthogonal transformation in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

.
 By the Euler theorem, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}$
\end_inset

 is a rotation around some axis by some angle.
 Show that the trace of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}$
\end_inset

 is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $1+2\cos\alpha$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is the angle of rotation.
 Show that the operator 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{S}\equiv\hat{R}-\hat{R}^{T}\]

\end_inset

is antisymmetric and, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{S}\neq0$
\end_inset

, can be represented as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{S}\vec{x}=\vec{v}\times\vec{x},\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}\in\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

 is the eigenvector of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}$
\end_inset

 with eigenvalue 1 (i.e.\InsetSpace ~
the axis of rotation).
 In this way, the angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 and the eigenvector 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}$
\end_inset

 can be easily read off the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}$
\end_inset

 (however, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{S}\neq0$
\end_inset

 then the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}$
\end_inset

 cannot be determined in this way).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Solution:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the Euler theorem, there exists an axis 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}$
\end_inset

 and the angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}$
\end_inset

 is a rotation around 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}$
\end_inset

 by angle 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

.
 The matrix representation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}$
\end_inset

 in an orthonormal basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \vec{v},\vec{w}_{1},\vec{w}_{2}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{R}=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & \cos\alpha & -\sin\alpha\\
0 & \sin\alpha & \cos\alpha\end{array}\right).\]

\end_inset

Therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Tr}\,\hat{R}=1+2\cos\alpha$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider now the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{S}$
\end_inset

 defined above.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{S}$
\end_inset

 is antisymmetric, there exists a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{a}\in\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{S}\vec{x}=\vec{a}\times\vec{x}$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

.
 It remains to show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{a}$
\end_inset

 is parallel to 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{v}$
\end_inset

.
 Indeed, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{S}\vec{v}=(\hat{R}-\hat{R}^{T})\vec{v}=(\hat{R}-\hat{R}^{-1})\vec{v}=0.\]

\end_inset

Therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{a}\times\vec{v}=0$

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to note that a quaternion contains only the information
 about the half-angle of rotation, so a rotation by 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi$
\end_inset

 may be represented by a nontrivial quaternion 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}=-\mathbf{1}$
\end_inset

 as well as by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}=\mathbf{1}$
\end_inset

.
 Imagine that we use a quaternion to keep track of the orientation of a
 rigid body; then the quaternion will 
\emph on
change
\emph default
 
\emph on
sign
\emph default
 after a rotation of the rigid body by 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi$
\end_inset

 and return to the original value only after another rotation by 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi$
\end_inset

 in the same direction.
 This unusual behavior is the main reason quaternions are useful in the
 construction of spinors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}_{\mathbf{c}}=\hat{R}_{-\mathbf{c}}$
\end_inset

, every two opposite quaternions correspond to the same three-dimensional
 rotation.
 The set of all normalized quaternions 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{c}:\left|\mathbf{c}\right|=1\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a sphere 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{3}$
\end_inset

 in the four-dimensional space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{H}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, the set 
\begin_inset Formula $SO(3)$
\end_inset

 is equivalent to a sphere 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{3}$
\end_inset

 with identified opposite points.
 We have thus defined a projection map 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{3}\rightarrow SO(3)$
\end_inset

 acting as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}\rightarrow\hat{R}_{\mathbf{c}}$
\end_inset

, and this map is everywhere 2-to-1.
 Such maps between manifolds are called 
\series bold
coverings

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{covering}

so in particular 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{3}\rightarrow SO(3)$

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, the sphere 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{3}$

\begin_inset Formula $A\in SU(2)$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the multiplication of quaternions corresponds, on the one hand,
 to the multiplication of matrices, and on the other hand, to multiplication
 of rotations.
 Thus the covering 
\begin_inset Formula $SU(2)\rightarrow SO(3)$
\end_inset

 is a group homomorphism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is no canonical way to define a smooth inverse map 
\begin_inset Formula $SO(3)\rightarrow SU(2)$
\end_inset

 because we would need to choose the sign of a quaternion according to

how many

\end_inset

 rotations were made,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and this information cannot be derived from one element of 
\begin_inset Formula $SO(3)$
\end_inset

.
 If one were given not only an element 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}\in SO(3)$
\end_inset

 but also a continuous path leading from the identity transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{1}\in SO(3)$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}$
\end_inset

, then one would be able to choose a unique element of 
\begin_inset Formula $SU(2)$
\end_inset

 corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}$
\end_inset

 (Paths in 
\begin_inset Formula $SO(3)$
\end_inset

 corresponding to an odd and an even number of 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi$
\end_inset

 rotations are topologically inequivalent and cannot be continuously deformed
 into each other.) On the other hand, we have seen that 
\emph on

\begin_inset Formula $SO(3)$

\begin_layout Standard
We have seen that a quaternion can be equivalently viewed as a two-dimensional

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 act as unitary matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\mathbf{c}}\in SU(2)$

 Although the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 does not belong to the real three-dimensional space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

, the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 can be transformed by a rotation 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{X}\in SO(3)$
\end_inset

 performed in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

 because we can find a quaternion 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{X}=\hat{R}_{\mathbf{c}}$
\end_inset

and transform the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$

 with the unitary matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\mathbf{c}}$
\end_inset

 (Note that unitary matrices preserve the Hermitian scalar product in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{C}^{2}$

\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$

 represents an unusual kind of a

 Such a transformation will leave invariant every spacelike vector orthogonal

 The subspace

 An explicit formula for 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}$

\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{L}\mathbf{x}=\lambda_{11}\mathbf{u}g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u})+\lambda_{12}\mathbf{u}g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{v})+\lambda_{21}\mathbf{v}g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u})+\lambda_{22}\mathbf{v}g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{v}).\]

Assuming 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{u})=g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})=1$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose a Lorentz transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}\in SO(3,1)$
\end_inset

 brings a timelike vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 into a (timelike) vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}=\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}$
\end_inset

 is itself a proper rotation, so we can still say that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}$
\end_inset

 is a product of a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

trivial
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 boost and a rotation.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\neq\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}_{1}$
\end_inset

 that brings 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 into 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
 After performing the boost, the 3-plane orthogonal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 is brought into the 3-plane 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}^{\perp}$
\end_inset

 orthogonal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
 Now we look for the remaining transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}_{2}\in SO(3,1)$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}=\hat{L}_{2}\hat{L}_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}_{2}$
\end_inset

 should leave 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 invariant, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}_{2}(\mathbf{v}^{\perp})\subset\mathbf{v}^{\perp}$
\end_inset

, and thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}_{2}$
\end_inset

 is a proper rotation.

To determine how spinors transform under a boost, we need to extend the

 Once each Lorentz transformation is mapped to a quaternion, the representation\InsetSpace ~

 still holds (its derivation is independent of the assumption that 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{j}$

\end_inset

 Note that a

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}=x_{0}\mathbf{1}+i\sum_{j=1}^{3}x_{j}\mathbf{h}_{j}$

 Hence,

\end_inset

 can be viewed as a real 4-vector with components 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x_{0},x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}\right)$
\end_inset

 Then we immediately find that the quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\mathbf{x}\right|^{2}=x_{0}^{2}-x_{1}^{2}-x_{2}^{2}-x_{3}^{2}$
\end_inset

 is conserved by transformations 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}_{\mathbf{c}}$

 Therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}_{\mathbf{c}}$
\end_inset

 act as Lorentz transformations in the 4-dimensional space of Hermitian
 quaternions 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 (The same result holds for anti-Hermitian quaternions

 The following simple considerations show that the inverse map, 
\begin_inset Formula $SO(3,1)\rightarrow\mathbb{H}\otimes\mathbb{C}$
\end_inset

 It follows from previous calculations that every 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\mathbf{c}\right|^{2}=1$
\end_inset

 is equal to an exponential of a

\end_inset

where now 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{j}$
\end_inset

 are also complex-valued.
 As before, only orientation-preserving transformations are generated by
 quaternions.
 Transformations 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}_{\exp\mathbf{b}}$
\end_inset

 with all real 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{j}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}\equiv\left(1,0,0,0\right)$
\end_inset

 These rotations form the subgroup 
\begin_inset Formula $SO(3)$

 Transformations with imaginary 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{j}$
\end_inset

 are boosts that preserve two spacelike vectors orthogonal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 (see Calculation below).
 Since every Lorentz transformation is a product of a proper rotation and
 a boost, and since the product of quaternions corresponds to the product
 of transformations, it follows that for any 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}\in SO(3,1)$

\end_inset

 complex matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\mathbf{c}}$

 acting in 
\begin_inset Formula $S\equiv\mathbb{C}^{2}$
\end_inset

 The condition 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\mathbf{c}\right|^{2}=1$
\end_inset

 is equivalent to 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{\mathbf{c}}=1$
\end_inset

, therefore the set of all the admissible quaternions is the same as the
 set of all 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times2$

 complex matrices with unit determinant.
 This set is denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$
\end_inset

 and is called the

 It is clear that we have built a group homomorphism 
\begin_inset Formula $SL(2,\mathbb{C})\rightarrow SO(3,1)$
\end_inset

 As before, quaternions 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $-\mathbf{c}$

 generate the same Lorentz transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{L}_{\mathbf{c}}$

 Thus, the map

 Therefore the matrix formula describing the transformation\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset Formula \[

\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{\mathbf{x}}=\sum_{j=0}^{3}\sigma_{j}x_{j},\]

\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{j}$

\begin_inset Formula $j=1,2,3$

The construction of spinors depends on the description of rotations in

 through quaternions.
 Quaternions work well for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

 and even for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{4}$
\end_inset

 if one considers complex-valued quaternions; however, quaternions cannot
 be straightforwardly generalized to describe higher-dimensional rotations.
 Instead, one can use the construction based on Clifford algebras.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Generally, an 
\series bold
algebra
\series default

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{algebra}

\end_inset

 is a vector space with a bilinear multiplication (any two vectors can be
 multiplied to yield another vector in the same space).
 So, to define an algebra, we need to specify a vector space and define
 the multiplication rule.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A formal definition of a Clifford algebra will be given in the next subsection.
 A motivation for introducing the Clifford algebra is found by recalling
 the construction of rotations in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

 through quaternions.
 We started with infinitesimal rotations and then exponentiated them to
 obtain finite rotations.
 An arbitrary infinitesimal rotation 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{S}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

 can be represented by the cross product 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{S}\vec{x}=\vec{v}\times\vec{x}$
\end_inset

, which is then replaced by a commutator 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\vec{v},\vec{x}\right]$
\end_inset

 computed in the quaternion algebra.
 A finite rotation is found by exponentiating the commutator, which yields
 the formula 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{\vec{v}}*\vec{x}*e^{-\vec{v}}$
\end_inset

.
 We would like to obtain a similar description for vectors from an arbitrary
 vector space 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 where, for instance, the vector 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cross
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 product is not defined.
 Thus, our goal is to find an algebra where the commutator corresponds to
 infinitesimal rotations in the vector space 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
 An arbitrary infinitesimal rotation 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{S}$
\end_inset

 is an antisymmetric tensor and can be identified with an element of 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{2}V$
\end_inset

, the space of bivectors, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
of linear combinations of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}+\mathbf{c}\wedge\mathbf{d}+...$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c},\mathbf{d},...\in V$
\end_inset

 and the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wedge
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge$
\end_inset

 represents the antisymmetric (exterior) tensor product.
 Thus it appears that we can obtain the required algebra only if the vector
 space of the algebra includes not only the vector space 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 but also, at least, the space of bivectors.
 The enlargement of the vector space did not appear in the case of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

 because the space of bivectors over 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

 is three-dimen\SpecialChar \-
sional and could be identified with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

 itself.
 In higher dimensions, this identification is not possible any more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to guess the new multiplication law, let us replace quaternions
 by bivectors in the case of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

.
 We can choose an orthonormal basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},\mathbf{e}_{2},\mathbf{e}_{3}\right\} $
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

 and note that the ordinary right-hand rule identifies the bivector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 with the cross product 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

; for instance, the bivector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}$
\end_inset

 is identified with the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{3}$
\end_inset

.
 At this point, we would like to avoid performing this identification.
 So we are motivated to replace the quaternionic units 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{h}_{1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{h}_{2}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{h}_{3}$
\end_inset

 by bivectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{3}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{3}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}$
\end_inset

, and also to replace cross products by bivectors where appropriate.
 In order to make contact with the standard definition of the Clifford algebra,
 we will choose the signs as follows:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{h}_{1}\mapsto-\mathbf{e}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{3},\quad\mathbf{h}_{2}\mapsto-\mathbf{e}_{3}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{1},\mathbf{h}_{3}\mapsto-\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}.\]

\end_inset

 The rules of quaternionic multiplication can now be written as rules for
 multiplication of vectors and bivectors: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We distinguish vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{a}\in\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

 from quaternionic units such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{h}_{1}\equiv\mathbf{e}_{3}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}\in\wedge^{2}\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

\end_inset

, and similarly for other quaternionic units.
\end_layout

\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\mathbf{e}_{3}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}\right)*\mathbf{e}_{2}=-\mathbf{e}_{2}*\left(\mathbf{e}_{3}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}\right)=\mathbf{e}_{3}.\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These rules of multiplication can be summarized as follows: if vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 are unit vectors such that 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=0$
\end_inset

 then
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\mathbf{x}*\mathbf{y} & =\mathbf{x}\wedge\mathbf{y},\quad\mathbf{x}*\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{1},\\
\mathbf{x}*(\mathbf{x}\wedge\mathbf{y}) & =\mathbf{y},\quad(\mathbf{x}\wedge\mathbf{y})*\mathbf{y}=\mathbf{x}.\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that the algebra of quaternions is equivalent to a larger algebra
 containing numbers, vectors, and bivectors.
 We have not yet completely defined the multiplication in the larger algebra;
 for instance, we have not yet defined 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}\right)*\mathbf{e}_{3}$
\end_inset

.
 According to the quaternion algebra, this is 
\begin_inset Formula $-\mathbf{h}_{3}*\vec{e}_{3}=\mathbf{1}$
\end_inset

, so it is natural to define 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\mathbf{e}_{3}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}\right)*\mathbf{e}_{1}=\mathbf{e}_{3}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{1}=-\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{3}.\]

\end_inset

Note that this is not a number but an antisymmetric tensor of rank 3.
 Since the space of antisymmetric 3-tensors over 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

 is one-dimensional, we again find a natural correspondence with the quaternion
 algebra.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since we are interested in representing rotations through an algebra, the

\begin_inset Formula \[
\vec{x}\mapsto\vec{x}+\lambda\vec{e}_{3}\times\vec{x}=\vec{x}+\frac{\lambda}{2}\left(\mathbf{h}_{3}*\vec{x}-\vec{x}*\mathbf{h}_{3}\right).\]

\end_inset

 We can easily check that this holds with the above multiplication rules
 if we use the bivector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

 instead of the quaternion 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{h}_{3}$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
The multiplication operator 
\begin_inset Formula $*$
\end_inset

 applied to orthonormal unit vectors can be summarized as follows.
 When all vectors in a product term are different, the term yields the exterior
 multiplication, e.g.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}*\mathbf{y}=\mathbf{x}\wedge\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}*\mathbf{y}*\mathbf{z}=\mathbf{x}\wedge\mathbf{y}\wedge\mathbf{z}$
\end_inset

.
 When not all vectors are different, any equal unit vectors can be brought
 together using antisymmetry, e.g.
\begin_inset Formula \[
...*\mathbf{a}*\mathbf{x}*\mathbf{b}*\mathbf{x}*...=-...*\mathbf{a}*\mathbf{b}*\mathbf{x}*\mathbf{x}*...\]

\end_inset

and then the product 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}*\mathbf{x}\equiv1$
\end_inset

 can be omitted, e.g.
\begin_inset Formula \[
...*\mathbf{a}*\mathbf{x}*\mathbf{x}*\mathbf{b}*...=...*\mathbf{a}*\mathbf{b}*...\]

\end_inset

This multiplication rule is associative but not commutative.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The vector space of the Clifford algebra 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Cl}(V)$
\end_inset

 is the same as the vector space of the exterior algebra of 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\text{Cl}(V)$
\end_inset

 consists of a direct sum of the spaces of all the possible antisymmetric
 tensors built out of vectors from 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 Thus, an element of 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Cl}(V)$
\end_inset

 could be of the form
\begin_inset Formula \[
\alpha_{0}\mathbf{1}+\mathbf{x}_{1}+\mathbf{x}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{x}_{3}+\mathbf{x}_{4}\wedge\mathbf{x}_{5}\wedge\mathbf{x}_{6}+...,\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{0}$
\end_inset

 is a number.
 The above is just an example; there could be of course more terms of each
 tensorial rank.

 In the Clifford algebra, a different multiplication rule is defined, which

 like the quaternion multiplication.
 The Clifford multiplication can be defined most concisely as follows.

 Scalars are multiplied with other terms in the natural way: for example,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sqrt{2}\mathbf{1}*(\mathbf{x}\wedge\mathbf{y})=\sqrt{2}\mathbf{x}\wedge\mathbf{y}.\]

\end_inset

Scalars commute with all other terms.
 In order to define the Clifford multiplication of arbitrary tensor terms,
 it is sufficient to define the multiplication of the form, say,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}\right)*\left(\mathbf{e}_{3}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{4}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{5}\right),\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{j}$
\end_inset

 are vectors from an 
\emph on
orthonormal
\emph default
 basis in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The multiplication of basis tensors is defined as follows.
 Suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},...,\mathbf{e}_{N}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is an orthonormal basis and 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{1}=\mathbf{e}_{i_{1}}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{i_{m}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{2}=\mathbf{e}_{j_{1}}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{j_{n}}$
\end_inset

 are two antisymmetric tensors built out of the vectors of this basis.
 We would like to define the Clifford product 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{1}*\psi_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 We first compute the exterior product 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{1}\wedge\psi_{2}$
\end_inset

, and we must find that either 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{1}\wedge\psi_{2}\neq0$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{1}\wedge\psi_{2}=0$
\end_inset

.
 In the first case, we define 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\psi_{1}*\psi_{2}\equiv\psi_{1}\wedge\psi_{2}\quad\text{if}\:\psi_{1}\wedge\psi_{2}\neq0.\]

\end_inset

Therefore, the exterior multiplication can be replaced by Clifford multiplicatio
n as long as all vectors are orthogonal to each other,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\psi_{1}=\mathbf{e}_{i_{1}}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{i_{m}}=\mathbf{e}_{i_{1}}*...*\mathbf{e}_{i_{m}},\]

\end_inset

and similarly for 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 It also follows that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{a}*\mathbf{b}=-\mathbf{b}*\mathbf{a}\quad\text{if}\; g(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})=0.\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the second case (
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{1}\wedge\psi_{2}=0$
\end_inset

), the resulting product 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{1}*\psi_{2}$
\end_inset

 will be a tensor of a lower rank.

\end_inset

 There must exist at least one basis vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{s}$
\end_inset

 that enters both 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Now there are two further cases: either 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{1}=\psi_{2}=\mathbf{e}_{s}$
\end_inset

, or 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{2}$
\end_inset

 have a higher rank.
 In the first case, we define 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{e}_{s}*\mathbf{e}_{s}\equiv\mathbf{1}.\]

\end_inset

In the second case, we use the antisymmetry of the exterior product to reorder
 the vectors in 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{2}$
\end_inset

 such that these tensors have the form
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula \[
\psi_{1}=\pm\mathbf{e}_{i_{1}}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{i_{m-1}}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{s},\quad\psi_{2}=\pm\mathbf{e}_{s}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{j_{2}}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{j_{n}}.\]

\end_inset


\series default
Then we define (with the appropriate sign)
\begin_inset Formula \[
\psi_{1}*\psi_{2}=\pm\left(\mathbf{e}_{i_{1}}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{i_{m-1}}\right)*\left(\mathbf{e}_{j_{2}}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{j_{n}}\right).\]

\end_inset

Now we have a Clifford product of two tensors of a lower rank; we use again
 the same rule until all Clifford products are simplified.
 Since the multiplication is defined by moving vectors together towards
 the symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $*$
\end_inset

, the rule is automatically associative.

Let us now use the Clifford algebra

\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As before, an arbitrary infinitesimal rotation 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{S}$
\end_inset

 is an antisymmetric operator.
 The space of antisymmetric operators is isomorphic to the space of bivectors.
 Explicitly, a bivector such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 is mapped to the antisymmetric operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{S}_{\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}}$
\end_inset

 that acts on vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{S}_{\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}}(\mathbf{x})\equiv\mathbf{a}g(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{x})-\mathbf{b}g(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{x}).\]

\end_inset

As shown in Exercise\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{S}_{\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}}(\mathbf{x})=\frac{1}{2}[\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b},\mathbf{x}].\]

\end_inset

A general antisymmetric operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{S}$
\end_inset

 may require more than one exterior product term, e.g.\InsetSpace ~
for a certain given
 operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{S}$
\end_inset

 we may need more vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}_{1}$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}_{1}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}_{2}$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}_{2}$

A finite rotation 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}_{\boldsymbol{\psi}}$
\end_inset

 is now obtained by exponentiating an infinitesimal rotation 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{S}_{\boldsymbol{\psi}}$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{R}_{\boldsymbol{\psi}}(\mathbf{x})\equiv\exp\left(\boldsymbol{\psi}\right)*\mathbf{x}*\exp\left(-\boldsymbol{\psi}\right).\]

\end_inset

As in the case of quaternions, one can easily show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}_{\boldsymbol{\psi}}$
\end_inset

 is an orthogonal transformation in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
 Indeed, since 
\begin_inset Formula \[
e^{\boldsymbol{\psi}}*e^{-\boldsymbol{\psi}}=\mathbf{1},\]

\end_inset

we have
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
g(\hat{R}_{\boldsymbol{\psi}}\mathbf{x},\hat{R}_{\boldsymbol{\psi}}\mathbf{x})\mathbf{1} & =(\hat{R}_{\boldsymbol{\psi}}\mathbf{x})*(\hat{R}_{\boldsymbol{\psi}}\mathbf{x})\\
 & =e^{\boldsymbol{\psi}}*\mathbf{x}*e^{-\boldsymbol{\psi}}*e^{\boldsymbol{\psi}}*\mathbf{x}*e^{-\boldsymbol{\psi}}\\
 & =e^{\boldsymbol{\psi}}*\mathbf{x}*\mathbf{x}*e^{-\boldsymbol{\psi}}\\
 & =e^{\boldsymbol{\psi}}*g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x})\mathbf{1}*e^{-\boldsymbol{\psi}}\\
 & =g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x})\mathbf{1}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Given an explicit formula for 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\psi}$
\end_inset

, one can compute 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{\boldsymbol{\psi}}$
\end_inset

 as follows.
 Assume, without loss of generality, that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\boldsymbol{\psi}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\lambda_{i}\mathbf{a}_{i}\wedge\mathbf{b}_{i},\]

\end_inset

where all the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{a}_{i},\mathbf{b}_{i}\right\} $
\end_inset

 are mutually orthogonal unit vectors, while 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

 are some numbers.
 We first note that a term 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}_{i}\wedge\mathbf{b}_{i}$
\end_inset

 commutes with any other term 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}_{j}\wedge\mathbf{b}_{j}$
\end_inset

 in the Clifford algebra: If 
\begin_inset Formula $i\neq j$
\end_inset

 then the Clifford product coincides with the exterior product, so
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\left(\mathbf{a}_{i}\wedge\mathbf{b}_{i}\right)*\left(\mathbf{a}_{j}\wedge\mathbf{b}_{j}\right) & =\mathbf{a}_{i}\wedge\mathbf{b}_{i}\wedge\mathbf{a}_{j}\wedge\mathbf{b}_{j}\\
 & =\mathbf{a}_{j}\wedge\mathbf{b}_{j}\wedge\mathbf{a}_{i}\wedge\mathbf{b}_{i}=\left(\mathbf{a}_{j}\wedge\mathbf{b}_{j}\right)*\left(\mathbf{a}_{i}\wedge\mathbf{b}_{i}\right).\end{align*}

\end_inset

 Therefore the exponential 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{\boldsymbol{\psi}}$
\end_inset

 can be factorized as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\exp\boldsymbol{\psi}=e^{\lambda_{1}\mathbf{a}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{b}_{1}}*...*e^{\lambda_{n}\mathbf{a}_{n}\wedge\mathbf{b}_{n}}.\]

\end_inset

Each single-term exponential is computed just as in the case of quaternions:
 since 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\right)*\left(\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\right)=-\left(\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{a}\right)*\left(\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\right)=-\mathbf{1},\]

\end_inset

we have
\begin_inset Formula \[
\exp\left(\lambda\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\right)=\mathbf{1}\cos\lambda+\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\sin\lambda.\]

\end_inset

Therefore
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\exp\boldsymbol{\psi} & =\left(\mathbf{1}\cos\lambda_{1}+\mathbf{a}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{b}_{1}\sin\lambda_{1}\right)*...\\
 & \qquad*(\mathbf{1}\cos\lambda_{n}+\mathbf{a}_{n}\wedge\mathbf{b}_{n}\sin\lambda_{n}).\end{align*}

\end_inset

Expanding the brackets, we would obtain an expression of the form
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\exp\boldsymbol{\psi} & =\cos\lambda_{1}...\cos\lambda_{n}\left(\mathbf{1}+\sum_{i=1}^{n}\mathbf{a}_{i}\wedge\mathbf{b}_{i}\tan\lambda_{i}+...\right)\\
 & \qquad+\mathbf{a}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{b}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{a}_{n}\wedge\mathbf{b}_{n}\sin\lambda_{1}...\sin\lambda_{n}.\end{align*}

 An arbitrary rotation 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}_{i}\equiv\hat{R}\mathbf{e}_{i}$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}_{1}$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}=\mathbf{f}_{1}$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}\neq\mathbf{f}_{1}$

\mathbf{f}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{1} & =\left(\mathbf{f}_{1}-\mathbf{e}_{1}g(\mathbf{f}_{1},\mathbf{e}_{1})\right)\wedge\mathbf{e}_{1}=\left(\mathbf{f}_{1}-\mathbf{e}_{1}\cos\phi\right)*\mathbf{e}_{1};\\
\left(\mathbf{f}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{1}\right)*\left(\mathbf{f}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{1}\right) & =-\left|\mathbf{f}_{1}-\mathbf{e}_{1}\cos\phi\right|^{2}=-\sin^{2}\phi;\\
\mathbf{f}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{1} & =\mathbf{b}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{1}\sin\phi,\quad\mathbf{b}_{1}\equiv\frac{1}{\sin\phi}\left(\mathbf{f}_{1}-\mathbf{e}_{1}\cos\phi\right);\\
\exp\left(\boldsymbol{\psi}_{1}\right) & =\mathbf{1}\cos\left(\lambda\sin\phi\right)+\mathbf{b}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{1}\sin\left(\lambda\sin\phi\right),\end{align*}

\end_inset

and then obtain
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\hat{R}_{\boldsymbol{\psi}}\mathbf{e}_{1} & =\exp\left(\boldsymbol{\psi}_{1}\right)*\mathbf{e}_{1}*\exp\left(-\boldsymbol{\psi}_{1}\right)\\
 & =\left(\mathbf{1}\cos\left(\lambda\sin\phi\right)+\mathbf{b}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{1}\sin\left(\lambda\sin\phi\right)\right)*\mathbf{e}_{1}\\
 & \quad*\left(\mathbf{1}\cos\left(\lambda\sin\phi\right)-\mathbf{b}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{1}\sin\left(\lambda\sin\phi\right)\right)\\
 & =\mathbf{e}_{1}\cos\left(2\lambda\sin\phi\right)+\mathbf{b}_{1}\sin\left(2\lambda\sin\phi\right).\end{align*}

\end_inset

This expression will be equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}_{1}$
\end_inset

 if
\begin_inset Formula \[
\cos\left(2\lambda\sin\phi\right)=g(\mathbf{e}_{1},\mathbf{f}_{1})=\cos\phi.\]

\end_inset

This determines the required value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\lambda=\frac{1}{2}\frac{\phi}{\sin\phi}.\]

\end_inset

Therefore, the required rotation 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}_{\boldsymbol{\psi}_{1}}$
\end_inset

 exists.
 The rotation 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}_{\boldsymbol{\psi}_{1}}$
\end_inset

 brings 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and all other basis vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{2}$
\end_inset

, ..., 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{N}$
\end_inset

 to some vectors that all belong to the orthogonal complement of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 The original rotation 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}$
\end_inset

 can be then represented as a composition of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}_{\boldsymbol{\psi}_{1}}$
\end_inset

 and an auxiliary rotation 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 that does not change 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}_{1}$
\end_inset

 but operates only within the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(N-1\right)$
\end_inset

-dimensional subspace orthogonal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}_{1}$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{R}=\hat{R}^{\prime}\circ\hat{R}_{\boldsymbol{\psi}_{1}}.\]

\end_inset

By the inductive hypothesis, the rotation 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 can be represented as a product of not more than 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(N-2\right)$
\end_inset

 rotations of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}_{\boldsymbol{\psi}_{2}}$
\end_inset

, ..., 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}_{\boldsymbol{\psi}_{n}}$
\end_inset

, where now 
\begin_inset Formula $n\leq N-1$
\end_inset

 Therefore, it is possible to express 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}$
\end_inset

 by
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{R}=\hat{R}_{\boldsymbol{\psi}_{2}}\circ...\circ\hat{R}_{\boldsymbol{\psi}_{n}}\circ\hat{R}_{\boldsymbol{\psi}_{1}}\]

 as required.

The fundamental 2-form
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the spinor space 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is two-dimensional, every 2-form on 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is proportional to an arbitrarily selected one.
 There is in fact a naturally selected 2-form, which we shall call the 
\series bold
fundamental 2-form
\series default
 and denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

.
 We shall now define the 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 by using the map 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\sigma}$
\end_inset

 and the Minkowski metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The map 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\sigma}$
\end_inset

 transforms 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Hermitian matrices
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 into 4-vectors, and we need to be more specific about the space of such
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

matrices.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 is a Hermitian matrix and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\sigma}h\in\mathbb{R}^{4}$
\end_inset

 is the corresponding 4-vector.
 Since the formula for the Lorentz transformation is
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{L}\left(\hat{\sigma}h\right)=\hat{\sigma}\left(\hat{L}_{s}h\hat{L}_{s}^{\dagger}\right),\]

\end_inset

it is clear that 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 is a spinorial tensor of rank 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1\bar{1},0\right)$
\end_inset

, i.e.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset Formula $h\in S\otimes\bar{S}$
\end_inset

.
 In the index notation, we may write the application of the map 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\sigma}$
\end_inset

 to such a tensor as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\hat{\sigma}h\right)^{\mu}=\sigma_{AA'}^{\mu}h^{AA'}.\]

\end_inset

Moreover, the property of being Hermitian means that 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{h}=h$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, the Minkowski metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 defines a bilinear form in the space 
\begin_inset Formula $S\otimes\bar{S}$
\end_inset

.
 We shall temporarily denote this bilinear form by angular brackets,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\langle h_{1},h_{2}\right\rangle \equiv g\left(\hat{\sigma}h_{1},\hat{\sigma}h_{2}\right).\]

\end_inset

On the other hand, we have (
\emph on
with some choice of basis
\emph default
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

) the explicit formula\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:real 4vector Pauli}

\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\hat{\sigma}h,\hat{\sigma}h)$
\end_inset

.
 The determinant of 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 is a quadratic form in the space 
\begin_inset Formula $S\otimes\bar{S}$
\end_inset

, and it is clear from the above equation that this quadratic form generates
 the bilinear form 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle h_{1},h_{2}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 However, the determinant can be expressed through the Levi-Civita symbol
 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\det h=\frac{1}{2}\varepsilon_{AB}\varepsilon_{A'B'}h^{AA'}h^{BB'}.\]

\end_inset

It follows that, 
\emph on
in the same basis 
\emph default
where Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:real 4vector Pauli}

\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
g_{\mu\nu}\sigma_{AA'}^{\mu}\sigma_{BB'}^{\nu}=\frac{1}{2}\varepsilon_{AB}\varepsilon_{A'B'}.\label{eq:g sigma sigma e e}\end{equation}

\end_inset

Although the above formula is written in a specific basis, it can be reinterpret
ed as the definition of the fundamental 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

.
 The form 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 is chosen as follows: First we take any nonzero 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\in S^{*}\wedge S^{*}$
\end_inset

; then we multiply 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 by a suitable constant 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon=\lambda\omega$
\end_inset

 satisfies Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:g sigma sigma e e}

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 is defined on 
\begin_inset Formula $S\wedge S$

\end_inset

 and the inverse form 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon^{-1}$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{*}\wedge S^{*}$
\end_inset

, as well as the corresponding conjugate forms.
 Note, however, that the 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 is antisymmetric and hence there is a choice of sign in defining the inverse.
 For instance, we might debate whether the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon^{-1}\mathbf{a}^{*}$
\end_inset

 should be defined by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\varepsilon(\varepsilon^{-1}\mathbf{a}^{*},\mathbf{b})\equiv\mathbf{a}^{*}\circ\mathbf{b}\]

\end_inset

or by 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon(\varepsilon^{-1}\mathbf{a}^{*},\mathbf{b})\equiv\mathbf{a}^{*}\circ\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

? The convention is to use the 
\emph on
first
\emph default
 argument of 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 (as shown above) but the 
\emph on
second
\emph default
 argument of 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 In the index notation, this corresponds to the following definitions,
\begin_inset Formula \[
a_{A}\varepsilon^{BA}=a^{B},\quad b^{B}\varepsilon_{BA}=b_{A},\quad\varepsilon^{AB}\varepsilon_{BC}=-\delta^{A}{}_{C}\equiv\varepsilon_{C}^{A}.\]

\end_inset

In the index notation, additional trouble arises because 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta^{A}{}_{C}=-\delta_{C}{}^{A}$
\end_inset

 if we raise and lower indices using 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{AB}$
\end_inset

, so one uses the unambiguous notation 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon^{A}{}_{C}=\varepsilon_{C}{}^{A}$
\end_inset

.
 The same conventions apply to the conjugate forms 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\varepsilon}_{A'B'}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\varepsilon}^{A'B'}$

 The basis vectors

Since the

 map is fixed, we can identify 4-vectors and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1\bar{1},0\right)$
\end_inset

 spinorial tensors.
 Let us now consider how we could construct some tensor objects out of spinors
 and in this way obtain a geometric interpretation for spinors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Firstly, a spinor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}\in S$
\end_inset

 defines a null vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}_{\mathbf{c}}=\hat{\sigma}(\mathbf{c}\otimes\bar{\mathbf{c}})$
\end_inset

.
 In components, this is written as 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{\mu}=\sigma_{AA'}^{\mu}c^{A}\bar{c}^{A'}$
\end_inset

 or more concisely 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{AA'}=c^{A}\bar{c}^{A'}$
\end_inset

.
 (The map 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\sigma}$
\end_inset

 is usually omitted for brevity since it is a fixed structure relating the
 spinor and the vector spaces.) One may say figuratively that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

a spinor is a square root of a null vector.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The null direction 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}_{\mathbf{c}}$
\end_inset

 is the principal geometric information contained in a spinor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

.
 However, spinors differing by a phase, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}e^{i\alpha}$
\end_inset

, define the same null vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}_{\mathbf{c}}$
\end_inset

.
 The phase information can be extracted if we define the 
\series bold
flag bivector
\series default

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{flag bivector}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
F_{(\mathbf{c})} & \equiv\mathbf{c}\otimes\mathbf{c}\otimes\bar{\varepsilon}+\varepsilon\otimes\bar{\mathbf{c}}\otimes\bar{\mathbf{c}},\nonumber \\
F^{AA'BB'} & \equiv c^{A}c^{B}\bar{\varepsilon}^{A'B'}+\varepsilon^{AB}\bar{c}^{A'}\bar{c}^{B'}.\label{eq:flag through c}\end{align}

\end_inset

The spinorial tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $F^{AA'BB'}$
\end_inset

 is equivalent to an antisymmetric bivector 
\begin_inset Formula $F^{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 satisfying 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
F^{\mu\nu}n_{\nu}=0,\quad F^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu}=0.\label{eq:flag property 1}\end{equation}

\end_inset

It follows that there exists a (
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

-dependent) vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{k}_{\mathbf{c}}$
\end_inset

 such that
\begin_inset Formula \[
F_{\mathbf{c}}=\mathbf{n}_{\mathbf{c}}\wedge\mathbf{k},\quad F^{\mu\nu}=n^{\mu}k^{\nu}-n^{\nu}k^{\mu},\quad g(\mathbf{n}_{\mathbf{c}},\mathbf{k}_{\mathbf{c}})=0.\]

\end_inset

The choice of the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{k}_{\mathbf{c}}$
\end_inset

 is up to a multiple of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}_{\mathbf{c}}$
\end_inset

, so the pair 
\begin_inset Formula $(\mathbf{n}_{\mathbf{c}},F_{\mathbf{c}})$
\end_inset

 only defines a null

\begin_layout Standard
These properties offer a possible geometric interpretation of spinors and
 illustrate the fact that spinors are related to null directions.
 Since the flag bivector carries the entire physical information in a spinor
 (the sign of a spinor is not observable), one could in principle forego
 spinors and reformulate every spinor equation in terms of unambiguously
 defined flag bivectors.
 However, flags are quadratic in spinors, and thus linear equations of motion
 for spinor fields will become nonlinear tensor equations if written in
 terms of flags.
 Spinors provide a simpler formulation of many equations, especially those
 with massless fields for which null directions are especially important.

\begin_layout Subsection
Simplification of spinorial tensors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the spinor space 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is two-dimensional, its properties are significantly simpler than those
 of a higher-dimensional space.
 For instance, every antisymmetric tensor of rank 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(0,2\right)$
\end_inset

 is proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, an arbitrary rank 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(0,2\right)$
\end_inset

 spinorial tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{AB}$
\end_inset

 can be simplified into a symmetric tensor and a multiple of 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
T_{AB} & =\frac{1}{2}\left(T_{AB}+T_{BA}\right)+\frac{1}{2}\left(T_{AB}-T_{BA}\right)\\
 & =T_{(AB)}+\frac{1}{2}\left(T_{CD}\varepsilon^{CD}\right)\varepsilon_{AB}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

 Moreover, every spinorial tensor can be reduced to a combination of products
 of the 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 and some totally symmetric tensors.

\end_layout

\end_inset

 For example, a rank 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(0,2\bar{2}\right)$
\end_inset

 tensor can be decomposed as
\begin_inset Formula \[
T_{ABA'B'}=T_{(AB)A'B'}+\frac{1}{2}T_{CDA'B'}\varepsilon^{CD}\varepsilon_{AB}.\]

\end_inset

The same decomposition can be applied to the primed indices.

\begin_inset Formula $T_{\mu\nu}$

\begin_inset Formula \[
T_{ABA'B'}=\phi_{AB}\bar{\varepsilon}_{A'B'}+\varepsilon_{AB}\bar{\phi}_{A'B'},\]

\end_inset

where the symmetric spinorial tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{AB}$
\end_inset

 of rank 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(0,2\right)$
\end_inset

 is defined by
\begin_inset Formula \[
\phi_{AB}\equiv\frac{1}{2}T_{ABA'B'}\bar{\varepsilon}^{A'B'}.\]

\begin_inset Formula $T_{ABA'B'}$

\begin_layout Paragraph
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A totally symmetric tensor of rank 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is completely determined by its values on a single vector; e.g.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset Formula $T(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y},\mathbf{z})$
\end_inset

 can be restored if we know 
\begin_inset Formula $T(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 for every 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

.
 Setting 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}=o+\iota z$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $o$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\iota$
\end_inset

 are two spinors building a spin frame, we find that 
\begin_inset Formula $T(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 is a cubic polynomial in 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

.
 A cubic polynomial can be factorized as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
T(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x})=\left(a_{0}+a_{1}z\right)\left(b_{0}+b_{1}z\right)\left(c_{0}+c_{1}z\right),\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{0},a_{1},...,c_{1}$
\end_inset

 are suitable complex numbers (not uniquely determined).
 We can interpret these numbers as the spin frame components 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{A}$

\begin_inset Formula $b_{A}$

\begin_inset Formula $c_{A}$

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{ABC}$
\end_inset

 is totally symmetric, we have obtained a decomposition 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{(ABC)}=a_{(A}b_{B}c_{C)}$
\end_inset

 The general case of a spinorial tensor of rank

 We define the modified map 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\sigma}(p):S\otimes\bar{S}\rightarrow T_{p}\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 by using a tetrad 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}(p)\right\} $
\end_inset

 which maps the result of

\begin_inset Formula $T_{p}\mathcal{M}$

\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{\tilde{\sigma}}(h^{AB'})=\sum_{j=0}^{3}\sigma_{AB'}^{j}h^{AB'}\mathbf{e}_{j}\in T_{p}\mathcal{M}.\]

\end_inset

This defines the curved-spacetime map 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\tilde{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}}(p)$
\end_inset

 which can be thought of a world-vector-valued spinorial 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(0,1\bar{1}\right)$
\end_inset

-tensor,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tilde{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}_{AB'}(p)\equiv\sum_{j=0}^{3}\sigma_{AB'}^{j}\mathbf{e}_{j}(p);\quad\tilde{\sigma}_{AB'}^{\mu}\equiv\sum_{j=0}^{3}\sigma_{AB'}^{j}e_{j}^{\mu}.\]

\end_inset

Due to the defining property\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:tetrad ortho}

\end_inset

) of a tetrad, we have
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
g_{\mu\nu}(p)\tilde{\sigma}_{AA'}^{\mu}(p)\tilde{\sigma}_{BB'}^{\nu}(p) & =\sum_{j,k=0}^{3}g_{\mu\nu}(p)e_{j}^{\mu}(p)\sigma_{AA'}^{j}e_{k}^{\mu}(p)\sigma_{BB'}^{k}\\
 & =\sum_{j,k=0}^{3}\eta_{jk}\sigma_{AA'}^{j}\sigma_{BB'}^{k}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Therefore, the spinorial 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{AB}$
\end_inset

 automatically satisfies the property analogous to Eq.\InsetSpace ~

\end_inset

 Different choices of the tetrad are related to teach other with Lorentz
 transformations.
 (For any two orthonormal tetrads 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\boldsymbol{\sigma}}$
\end_inset

 and the 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{AB}$

 are invariant under Lorentz transformations.
 Thus, any Lorentz-invariant spinorial expression, such as

 cannot be defined on spinor fields.
 One way to explain the fact that only the Levi-Civita connection is defined
 on spinors is to consider the flag field 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mathbf{n}_{\psi},F_{\psi}\right)$
\end_inset

 corresponding to a spinor field 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 Suppose we attempt to define a parallelly transported spinor 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$

 using some connection 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla$
\end_inset

 We say that 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$

 is

parallelly transported along a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\psi^{A}=0$

 Then we expect that the flag 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mathbf{n}_{\psi},F_{\psi}\right)$
\end_inset

 should also be parallelly transported along 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 However, the basic properties (
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:flag property 1}

 Unless the connection 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla$

 is compatible with the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g$

 Only the metric-compatible (Levi-Civita) connection guarantees that the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another argument is based on the concept of associated bundles.
 The spinor bundle is associated to the gauge group 
\begin_inset Formula $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$

\begin_inset Formula $SO(3,1)$

 The Levi-Civita connection

 No other connection is admissible in the associated bundle.

The electromagnetic field corresponds to a particle of spin

 and is described by a 2-form 
\begin_inset Formula $F=dA$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is a 1-form representing the electromagnetic potential.
 In the index notation, 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 is the antisymmetric tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $F^{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 We have seen that such a tensor can be reduced to a symmetric spinorial
 tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi^{AB}$
\end_inset

 by
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\phi^{AB} & =\frac{1}{2}\bar{\varepsilon}_{A'B'}F^{AA'BB'},\\
F^{AA'BB'} & =\phi^{AB}\bar{\varepsilon}^{A'B'}+\varepsilon^{AB}\bar{\phi}^{A'B'}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Now we shall show that the Maxwell equations can be written concisely in
 terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi^{AB}$
\end_inset

, namely
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\nabla_{AA'}\phi^{AB}=\frac{1}{2}\bar{\varepsilon}_{A'B'}j^{BB'},\label{eq:maxwell phi}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $j^{BB'}\equiv j^{\mu}\sigma_{\mu}^{BB'}$

\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\nabla_{\mu}F^{\mu\nu} & =j^{\nu},\\
\nabla_{\mu}\left(^{*}F^{\mu\nu}\right) & =0.\end{align*}

\end_inset

(The last equation is equivalent to 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla^{[\lambda}F^{\mu\nu]}=0$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $dF=0$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $ddA=0$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $F=dA$
\end_inset

(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:epsilonAABB}

\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{\kappa\lambda\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

, it is straightforward to verify that
\begin_inset Formula \[
F^{AA'BB'}+i\left(*F\right)^{AA'BB'}=2\phi^{AB}\bar{\varepsilon}^{A'B'}.\]

\end_inset

Then, the Maxwell equations are equivalent to 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
j^{\nu} & =\nabla_{\mu}(F^{\mu\nu}+i*F^{\mu\nu})=2\nabla_{AA'}\left(\phi^{AB}\bar{\varepsilon}^{A'B'}\right)\\
 & =2\left(\nabla_{AA'}\phi^{AB}\right)\bar{\varepsilon}^{A'B'},\end{align*}

\end_inset

since

\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 under 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla$

\begin_inset Formula \[

\end_inset

Dirac's main motivation was to rewrite this second-order equation as a system
 of first-order equations.
 The standard way to achieve this is to introduce extra fields for first
 derivatives.
 So let us introduce an auxiliary (complex conjugate and dual) spinor field
 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\sigma}_{A'}$
\end_inset

, which will be the first derivative of 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi^{A}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\bar{\sigma}_{A'}\equiv\nabla_{AA'}\phi^{A}.\]

\end_inset

We expect that the equation for 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\sigma}_{A'}$
\end_inset

 will be of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla^{BA'}\bar{\sigma}_{A'}=(...)$
\end_inset

, and we shall now derive that equation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We need to simplify the expression
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\nabla^{BA'}\bar{\sigma}_{A'}=\nabla^{BA'}\nabla_{AA'}\phi^{A}.\label{eq:expr 1 dirac}\end{equation}

\end_inset

Let us first consider a more general spinorial tensor of this form,
\begin_inset Formula \[
X_{AA'BB'C}\equiv\nabla_{BB'}\nabla_{AA'}\phi_{C};\]

\end_inset

when we are done simplifying 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{AA'BB'C}$
\end_inset

, the term\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:expr 1 dirac}

\end_inset

) will be expressed as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\nabla^{BB'}\nabla_{AA'}\phi^{A}=\bar{\varepsilon}^{A'B'}\varepsilon^{AC}\varepsilon^{BD}X_{DB'AA'C}.\label{eq:expr 2 dirac}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since we are working in flat space where the curvature identically vanishes,
 the covariant derivatives commute (even when acting on arbitrary tensors
 or spinors), so 
\begin_inset Formula \[
X_{AA'BB'C}=X_{BB'AA'C}.\]

\end_inset

Thus we can apply the decomposition\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:symmetric TABAB decomp}

\end_inset

), suitable for symmetric 4-tensors, to the first four indices of 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{AA'BB'C}$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
X_{AA'BB'C} & =X_{(AB)(A'B')C}+\frac{1}{4}\varepsilon_{AB}\bar{\varepsilon}_{A'B'}Y_{C},\label{eq:expr 2a dirac}\\
Y_{C} & \equiv X_{AA'BB'C}\varepsilon^{AB}\bar{\varepsilon}^{A'B'}.\nonumber \end{align}

\end_inset

It is easy to see that
\begin_inset Formula \[
Y_{C}=\varepsilon^{AB}\bar{\varepsilon}^{A'B'}\nabla_{AA'}\nabla_{BB'}\phi_{C}=g^{\alpha\beta}\nabla_{\alpha}\nabla_{\beta}\phi_{C}=\square\phi_{C}.\]

\end_inset

When we substitute Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:expr 2a dirac}

\end_inset

) into Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:expr 2 dirac}

\end_inset

), the symmetric term 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{(AB)(A'B')C}$
\end_inset

 will be canceled after contracting with 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\varepsilon}^{A'B'}$
\end_inset

 in Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:expr 2 dirac}

\end_inset

).
 Therefore, only the term containing 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{C}$
\end_inset

 survives.
 After some simplification, we find the equation for 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\sigma}_{A'}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\nabla^{BA'}\bar{\sigma}_{A'}=\nabla^{BA'}\nabla_{AA'}\phi^{A}=\frac{1}{2}\square\phi^{B}=-\frac{1}{2}m^{2}\phi^{B}.\]

The conventional definition of the auxiliary field is

\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}m^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Then the equations acquire a more symmetric form,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\nabla_{AA'}\phi^{A} & =\frac{m}{\sqrt{2}}\bar{\chi}_{A'},\\
\nabla^{BA'}\bar{\chi}_{A'} & =-\frac{m}{\sqrt{2}}\phi^{B}.\end{align*}

At this point, we are done rewriting the second-order equation\InsetSpace ~

 We now introduce a four-dimensional, complex-valued vector

 (ii) The speed of light, denoted 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

, is independent of the speed of the light source.
 One can derive all the statements of SR from these two postulates.
 For instance, it is shown that no massive body can be accelerated from
 rest to a velocity greater than or equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

.
 Also, the distance 
\begin_inset Formula $x'$
\end_inset

 and time 
\begin_inset Formula $t'$
\end_inset

 measured in a moving reference frame must be different from the distance
 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 measured in a rest frame.
 Namely, the results of these measurements are related by the 
\series bold

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{Lorentz transformation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
ct' & =\gamma\left(ct-\beta x\right),\quad x'=\gamma(x-\beta ct),\\
\gamma & \equiv\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\beta^{2}}},\quad\beta\equiv\frac{v}{c},\end{align*}

\end_inset

where we assume that the motion is in the positive 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 direction, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta<1$
\end_inset

 is the relative velocity of the two reference frames, measured in the units
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 is an absolute constant, one can measure velocities in the units of 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 and distances in the units of time.
 This choice of measurement units is mathematically equivalent to setting
 
\begin_inset Formula $c\equiv1$
\end_inset

 in all equations, and we adopt this convention everywhere in this text.

\begin_layout Standard
The fact that coordinates and times are generally not measured to be the
 same in different reference frames is at the core of the theory of relativity;
 for instance, events seen as simultaneous for one observer may precede
 one another for a different observer.
 Thus, simultaneity is not absolute but is only defined

\begin_layout Subsection
Spacetime
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rather than use distances and times measured in different reference frames,
 one adopts a more convenient way to describe events.
 Namely, one introduces the 
\series bold
spacetime
\series default
, which is an auxiliary four-dimensional vector space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 with coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ t,x,y,z\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 This space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}\equiv\mathbb{R}^{4}$
\end_inset

 is called the 
\series bold
Minkowski spacetime
\series default
.
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{Minkowski spacetime}

\end_inset

 In the spacetime picture, events 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\in\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\equiv\left\{ t,x,y,z\right\} $
\end_inset

 are 
\emph on
points
\emph default
 of the spacetime (vectors such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 are denoted by boldface letters).
 Bodies follow 
\series bold
worldlines
\series default
 
\begin_inset Formula $x(t),y(t),z(t)$
\end_inset

 which may be drawn as lines in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 and parametrized by functions 
\begin_inset Formula $x(t),y(t),z(t)$
\end_inset

.
 It is usually more convenient to parametrize worldlines by four functions
 
\begin_inset Formula $t(\tau),x(\tau),y(\tau),z(\tau)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 is a real-valued parameter.
 Then a worldline can be represented by a point-valued function 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}(\tau)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A Lorentz transformation between inertial frames will then be seen as a
 linear transformation of the coordinates in the spacetime, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ t,x,y,z\right\} \rightarrow\left\{ t',x',y',z'\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 However, it is natural to think of the spacetime as an independent arena
 where events happen, regardless of coordinates introduced in it.
 In other words, the coordinate values 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(t,x,y,z\right)$
\end_inset

 ascribed to an event 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 by a particular inertial observer may vary, but the event 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 happens by itself at a particular 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

place-and-time,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 whether observed or not.
 (We may imagine the spacetime 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 as a chart containing complete histories of all the bodies and a complete
 record of all the events that happened or will ever happen.) To differentiate
 between ordinary three-dimensional vectors and four-dimensional vectors
 from 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

, the latter are frequently called 
\series bold
4-vectors
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is easy to see that the Lorentz transformation preserves the quadratic
 form,
\begin_inset Formula \[
g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x})\equiv t^{2}-x^{2}-y^{2}-z^{2},\]

\end_inset

called the 
\series bold
relativistic interval
\series default
 or the 
\series bold
Minkowski metric
\series default
.
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{Minkowski metric}

\end_inset

 In fact, the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 has a far greater significance than merely an invariant of Lorentz transformati
ons.
 The most important use of 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is in computing distances and time intervals between events.
 Given two events, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

, we may ask whether an inertial observer might pass through both 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

.
 If this is the case then these events will have coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ t_{1},0,0,0\right\} $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ t_{2},0,0,0\right\} $
\end_inset

 in this observer's rest frame.
 The time interval, 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{2}-t_{1}$
\end_inset

, measured according to this observer's clock, is called the observer's
 
\series bold
proper time
\series default
 interval between 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

.
 This interval can be computed as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Delta\tau(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\equiv\sqrt{\left(t_{2}-t_{1}\right)^{2}}=\sqrt{g(\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{x})}.\]

\end_inset

The 4-vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 connecting the events in the Minkowski space is then called a 
\series bold
timelike vector
\series default
.
 The last term in the above formula is expressed through 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 and is thus Lorentz-invariant.
 Hence, any observer can compute the proper time 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau\left(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\right)$
\end_inset

 using this formula.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another possibility is the existence of a lightray connecting the events
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

.
 
\series bold
Lightrays
\series default
 are worldlines of bodies that move with the speed of light; for example,
 the line 
\begin_inset Formula $x=t,y=z=0$
\end_inset

 is a lightray.
 It is easy to see that the squared interval in this case is 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{x})=0$
\end_inset

.
 The 4-vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 connecting the events is then called a 
\series bold
null vector
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, there may be an inertial observer for whom the events 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 are 
\emph on
simultaneous
\emph default
 and thus have coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ t_{0},x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}\right\} $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ t_{0},y_{1},y_{2},y_{3}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 In this case, 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{x})<0$
\end_inset

, the 4-vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 is called a 
\series bold
spacelike vector
\series default
, and the real number
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Delta L(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\equiv\sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^{3}\left(y_{j}-x_{j}\right)^{2}}=\sqrt{-g(\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{x})}\]

\end_inset

is equal to the distance between the points 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 in the reference frame where both events occur simultaneously.
 The quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta L(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$
\end_inset

 is called the 
\series bold
proper distance
\series default
 between the events.
 Again, this distance can be calculated in any other reference frame using
 the above formula involving 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conversely, it can be shown that the sign of 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 unambiguously specifies which of the three above cases (timelike, null,
 or spacelike) takes place.
 Thus, the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 provides not only a means to compute the proper time and the proper distance
 between events in an arbitrary reference frame, but also 
\emph on
classifies
\emph default
 pairs of events according to whether their separation is timelike, null,
 or spacelike.
 Since no material bodies or signals can propagate faster than light, only
 events separated by a timelike or null interval can influence or cause
 each other.
 Hence, the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 determines which points of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 can causally influence each other, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
describes the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have arrived at a picture of the Minkowski spacetime 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 whose points are events and where a metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is defined.
 Reference frames corresponding to different inertial observers are merely
 coordinate systems that we may introduce on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

.
 Using this picture, known physical laws can be reformulated only using
 4-vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 and the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

, without reference to a particular coordinate system on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, the laws of physics have a frame-invariant character compatible
 with the Lorentz transformations, which means that these laws are 
\series bold
relativistic
\series default
 (agree with Special Relativity).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that, according to a standard result of linear algebra, the quadratic
 form 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 gives rise to a symmetric bilinear form 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$
\end_inset

 which we may define by
\begin_inset Formula \[
g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=\frac{1}{2}\left(g(\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{y},\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{y})-g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x})-g(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{y})\right).\]

\end_inset

 Clearly, 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 plays the role of the scalar product in the 4-dimensional vector space
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

.
 In coordinates: if 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\equiv\left\{ x_{0},x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}\right\} $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}\equiv\left\{ y_{0},y_{1},y_{2},y_{3}\right\} $
\end_inset

 then
\begin_inset Formula \[
g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=x_{0}y_{0}-x_{1}y_{1}-x_{2}y_{2}-x_{3}y_{3}.\]

\end_inset

This bilinear form is also called the 
\series bold
Minkowski metric
\series default
.
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{Minkowski metric}

\end_inset

 Two 4-vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 are called 
\series bold
orthogonal
\series default
 to each other if 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=0$
\end_inset

.
 Note that the unusual signs in the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 make the geometric interpretation of the scalar product 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$
\end_inset

 and of the orthogonality somewhat difficult.
 For instance, a null vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

, such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 1,1,0,0\right\} $
\end_inset

, is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

orthogonal to itself
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 since 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x})=0$
\end_inset

.
 However, in any given reference frame, the time direction is always orthogonal
 to every spatial direction, and the three spatial directions are also mutually
 orthogonal, just like in normal Euclidean geometry.
 From the point of view of linear algebra, the assumption of an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

inertial frame
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is equivalent to choosing a basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{0},\mathbf{e}_{1},\mathbf{e}_{2},\mathbf{e}_{3}\right\} $
\end_inset

 in the vector space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$

 It is convenient to choose

Let us now introduce the index notation.
 In a chosen reference frame, a 4-vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$

 has four coordinates (also called 
\series bold
components

\begin_inset Formula $x^{0},x^{1},x^{2},x^{3}$
\end_inset

 with an upper (superscript) index; the index value 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 means 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

time
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 and the values 
\begin_inset Formula $1,2,3$
\end_inset

 mean spatial coordinates.
 The scalar product of two 4-vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 can then be written as
\begin_inset Formula \[
g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=\sum_{\mu=0}^{3}\sum_{\nu=0}^{3}g_{\mu\nu}x^{\mu}x^{\nu},\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 is a 
\begin_inset Formula $4\times4$

\begin_inset Formula \[
g_{\mu\nu}\equiv\textrm{diag}(1,-1,-1,-1)\equiv\left(\begin{array}{cccc}

0 & -1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & -1 & 0\\

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The low (subscript) position of indices in the symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}$

 For brevity, it is customary to use the 
\series bold
Einstein summation convention
\series default
, which consists of dropping the summation signs and implying summation
 every time an identical index letter appears once as a subscript and once
 as a superscript.
 Then, 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$
\end_inset

 is written as 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}x^{\mu}x^{\nu}$
\end_inset

.
 Also, one does not distinguish between a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 and the array 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\mu}$

\begin_inset Formula $x^{\mu}$

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 This is the essence of the index notation: It is always assumed that a
 basis is chosen and that one is performing calculations with components
 of vectors and tensors in the chosen basis.
 All 4-vectors and 4-tensors then appear as tables of numbers, which are
 indexed by (Greek) letters, for example: 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\mu}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $g^{\alpha\beta}$

\begin_inset Formula \[
\Lambda:\mathbf{x}\rightarrow\mathbf{x}';\quad x'^{\mu}=\Lambda_{\nu}^{\mu}x^{\nu}.\]

\end_inset

It is easy to see that the condition of Lorentz invariance of the metric
 is written as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Lambda_{\alpha}^{\mu}\Lambda_{\beta}^{\nu}g_{\mu\nu}=g_{\alpha\beta}.\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, one introduces the Kronecker delta symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{\mu}^{\nu}$

\begin_inset Formula $g^{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 such that
\begin_inset Formula \[
g_{\alpha\beta}g^{\alpha\gamma}=\delta_{\beta}^{\gamma}.\]

\end_inset

Numerically, 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{\mu\nu}=\textrm{diag}(1,-1,-1,-1)$

A standard example of a covector is the function which maps

\begin_inset Formula $s_{\mu}=g_{\mu\nu}b^{\nu}.$

 It is customary to refer to the relation between the vector

 by the same letter (rather than by different letters as I have done here).
 Thus, one writes 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{\mu}$

Transition to General Relativity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Einstein's main motivation for introducing General Relativity was to remove
 the restriction to inertial frames and to admit arbitrary non-inertial,
 that is, 
\emph on
accelerated
\emph default
 reference frames.
 Since gravitation is locally equivalent to an accelerated reference frame
 (the 
\series bold
equivalence principle
\series default
), he hoped to achieve a description of gravitation in this way.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once we admit arbitrary non-inertial reference frames, we must assume that
 the coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 may be curvilinear, while the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 may be non-diagonal and generally coordinate-dependent.
 Thus, the theory of General Relativity is obtained from Special Relativity
 by the following steps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(1) We replace the Minkowski spacetime 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}=\mathbb{R}^{4}$
\end_inset

, which is itself a vector space, by an arbitrary four-dimensional space
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

, called the 
\series bold
spacetime manifold
\series default
.
 Coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 are chosen arbitrarily.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(2) The Minkowski metric 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{\mu\nu}=\textrm{diag}(1,-1,-1,-1)$
\end_inset

 is replaced by a symmetric tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}(x)=g_{\nu\mu}(x)$
\end_inset

 which can depend on the coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\mu}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, we imagine that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 is an arbitrarily curved spacetime rather than a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

flat
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Minkowski spacetime.
 (A spacetime manifold is 
\series bold
flat
\series default
 if there exists a coordinate system in which the metric tensor is 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}(p)=\eta_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 at every point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 A manifold is 
\series bold
curved
\series default
 if no such coordinate system can be found.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(3) The signature of the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 must remain 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(+--\,-\right)$
\end_inset

 everywhere.
 In particular, for each event 
\begin_inset Formula $p\in\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 there must exist a local coordinate system where 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}(p)=\textrm{diag}(1,-1,-1,-1)$
\end_inset

.
 Moreover, there exists a local coordinate system (called a 
\series bold
locally inertial frame
\series default
) where the physical laws at the event 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 are exactly the same as in Special Relativity in the absence of gravitation.
 Thus, gravitation is locally equivalent to a non-inertial reference frame
 (the 
\series bold
equivalence principle
\series default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(4) Physical laws, which were previously made relativistic (compatible with
 arbitrary inertial frames and rewritten through the Minkowski metric),
 are now reformulated in a way that is independent of the choice of coordinate
 systems and admits arbitrary, non-inertial coordinates.
 In particular, in every equation the Minkowski metric is replaced by the
 tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}(x)$
\end_inset

.
 Scalar products and the raising/lowering of tensor indices is performed
 using 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}(x)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(5) The theory prescribes equations (the Einstein equations) that can be
 used to determine the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}(x)$
\end_inset

 from a given distribution of matter in the entire spacetime.
 The Einstein equations involve the 
\emph on
curvature
\emph default
 of the spacetime and the energy-momentum tensor of matter (see below).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It follows from (1) that the coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 are not themselves 4-vectors any more, and for instance the coordinates
 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 of two events cannot be simply subtracted to obtain a 4-vector 
\begin_inset Formula $y^{\mu}-x^{\mu}$
\end_inset

.
 Moreover, the theory must be invariant under arbitrary coordinate transformatio
ns,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
x^{\mu}\rightarrow\tilde{x}^{\mu}(x^{0},x^{1},x^{2},x^{3}).\label{eq:coord trans}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 However, the derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $\dot{x}^{\mu}\equiv dx^{\mu}/d\tau$
\end_inset

 actually 
\emph on
is
\emph default
 a 4-vector because it is the difference of coordinates at infinitesimally
 close points, and such points belong to an almost-Minkowski local environment
 which exists according to (3).
 The fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{\mu}\equiv dx^{\mu}/d\tau$
\end_inset

 is a 4-vector can be also formally established by considering the change
 of the components 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 under the transformation\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:coord trans}

\end_inset

),
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
u^{\mu}\rightarrow\tilde{u}^{\mu}\equiv\frac{d}{d\tau}\tilde{x}^{\mu}=\frac{\partial\tilde{x}^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\nu}}\frac{dx^{\nu}}{d\tau}=\frac{\partial\tilde{x}^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\nu}}u^{\nu},\label{eq:vector transf law}\end{equation}

\end_inset

which is the usual linear transformation law for components of a vector
 under a general change of basis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hence, the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}(x)$
\end_inset

 still determines proper times and proper distances, but only between infinitesi
mally close events.
 To make this statement, one frequently writes a somewhat strange-looking
 equation
\begin_inset Formula \[
ds^{2}=g_{\mu\nu}dx^{\mu}dx^{\nu},\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $dx^{\mu}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 means an infinitesimal displacement between two nearby points, and 
\begin_inset Formula $ds^{2}$
\end_inset

 is not really a square of any 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $ds$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 since 
\begin_inset Formula $ds^{2}$
\end_inset

 may also be negative.
 (One can regard the above equation simply as a

a meaningless but convenient and widely understood shorthand

\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

) To determine the proper time interval between two widely separated events
 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{(0)}^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{(1)}^{\mu}$
\end_inset

, we need to select a line in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 leading from 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{(0)}^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{(1)}^{\mu}$
\end_inset

, say a curve 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\mu}(s)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 is some parameter such that 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\mu}(0)=x_{(0)}^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\mu}(1)=x_{(1)}^{\mu}$
\end_inset

, and integrate along the curve,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Delta\tau\equiv\int_{0}^{1}\sqrt{g_{\mu\nu}\left(x^{\mu}(s)\right)\frac{dx^{\mu}}{ds}\frac{dx^{\nu}}{ds}}\textrm{d}s.\]

\end_inset

Here we assume that curve 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\mu}(s)$
\end_inset

 is such that 
\begin_inset Formula $dx^{\mu}/ds$
\end_inset

 is everywhere timelike, so the expression under the square root is positive.
 Such curves are called 
\series bold
timelike
\series default
 
\series bold
worldlines

 The resulting time interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta\tau$
\end_inset

 will of course depend on the chosen curve 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\mu}(s)$
\end_inset

, but not on the choice of the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 along the curve.
 In general, it is not easy to determine whether there exists a timelike
 curve connecting two given points in the spacetime.
 It might happen that only a null or a spacelike curve connects two given
 events.
 (Two events are 
\series bold
timelike separated
\series default
 if they can be connected by a timelike worldline.) Without a detailed analysis
 of the behavior of the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 everywhere in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

, it is not immediately clear whether two given events can causally influence
 each other.

The requirement (4) above means, in particular, that the relativistic Newton's
 law\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Newton law}

) should be rewritten so that it holds in all coordinate systems.
 An immediate difficulty with this requirement is that the laws of physics
 involve derivatives of vectors, and taking a derivative of a vector or
 a tensor in an arbitrary coordinate system in curved space is a somewhat
 complicated operation.
 For instance, 
\begin_inset Formula $d^{2}x^{\mu}/d\tau^{2}$

\emph default
 a correct expression for the

-th component of the 4-acceleration, unless we are using Cartesian coordinates
 in flat Minkowski spacetime.
 Let us examine this problem in more detail; we shall begin by considering
 derivatives in curved coordinates in 
\emph on
flat
\emph default
 space, and then generalize to curved space.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Curved coordinates
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\mu}(\tau)$
\end_inset

 is the worldline of a particle in the flat Minkowski spacetime specified
 in a rectangular coordinate system 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x^{\mu}\right\} $
\end_inset

, and suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \tilde{x}^{\mu}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a curvilinear coordinate system related to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x^{\mu}\right\} $
\end_inset

 by four given functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f^{\mu}(x)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu=0,1,2,3$
\end_inset

, as 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{x}^{\mu}=f^{\mu}(x^{0},x^{1},x^{2},x^{3})$
\end_inset

.
 The components of 4-velocity in the coordinate system 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x^{\mu}\right\} $
\end_inset

 are 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{\mu}\equiv dx^{\mu}/d\tau$
\end_inset

, and the components of the 4-acceleration are 
\begin_inset Formula $a^{\mu}\equiv d^{2}x^{\mu}/d\tau^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 In the coordinate system 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \tilde{x}^{\mu}\right\} $
\end_inset

, the new components of the 4-velocity, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{u}^{\mu}$
\end_inset

, and the 4-acceleration, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{a}^{\mu}$
\end_inset

, must be calculated according to Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:vector transf law}

\end_inset

):
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\tilde{u}^{\mu}=\frac{\partial f^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\nu}}u^{\nu},\quad\tilde{a}^{\mu}=\frac{\partial f^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\nu}}a^{\nu}=\frac{\partial f^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\nu}}\frac{du^{\nu}}{d\tau}.\label{eq:new u a}\end{equation}

\end_inset

The worldline of the particle in the new coordinate system is 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{x}^{\mu}(\tau)\equiv f^{\mu}(x(\tau))$
\end_inset

, and so one might try to compute the 4-velocity and the 4-acceleration
 directly in the coordinate system 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \tilde{x}^{\mu}\right\} $
\end_inset

 by computing derivatives 
\begin_inset Formula $d\tilde{x}^{\mu}/d\tau$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $d^{2}\tilde{x}^{\mu}/d\tau^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Now, the 4-velocity will be computed correctly because, by virtue of the
 chain rule, 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{\alpha}f(x)=\left(\partial f/\partial x\right)\partial_{\alpha}x$
\end_inset

, and hence
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{d\tilde{x}^{\mu}}{d\tau}=\frac{\partial f^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\nu}}\frac{dx^{\nu}}{d\tau}=\frac{\partial f^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\nu}}u^{\nu}=\tilde{u}^{\mu}.\]

\end_inset

However, the 4-acceleration would be found incorrectly if one uses the formula
 
\begin_inset Formula $d\tilde{u}^{\mu}/d\tau$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
\frac{d}{d\tau}\tilde{u}^{\mu} & =\frac{d}{d\tau}\left(\frac{\partial f^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\nu}}u^{\nu}\right)=u^{\nu}\frac{d}{d\tau}\left(\frac{\partial f^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\nu}}\right)+\frac{\partial f^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\nu}}\frac{du^{\nu}}{d\tau}\nonumber \\
 & =u^{\nu}\frac{d}{d\tau}\left(\frac{\partial f^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\nu}}\right)+\tilde{a}^{\mu}.\label{eq:umu incorrect}\end{align}

\end_inset

For a general coordinate transformation (not merely a linear change of coordinat
es where 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial f^{\mu}/\partial x^{\nu}=\textrm{const}$
\end_inset

), we have 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{d}{d\tau}\left(\frac{\partial f^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\nu}}\right)\neq0,\]

\end_inset

therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{a}^{\mu}\neq d\tilde{u}^{\mu}/d\tau$
\end_inset

.
 So the formula 
\begin_inset Formula $d\tilde{u}^{\mu}/d\tau$
\end_inset

 cannot be used in a general coordinate system 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \tilde{x}^{\mu}\right\} $
\end_inset

 to compute the components of the 4-acceleration 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{a}^{\mu}$
\end_inset

.
 The reason for the problem is that the coordinate system 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \tilde{x}^{\mu}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is curved and so the derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $d\tilde{u}^{\mu}/d\tau$
\end_inset

 reflects not only the change in the 4-velocity, but also the change in
 the directions of coordinate axes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A correct expression for 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{a}^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 is given in Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:new u a}

 Nevertheless, we would like to have a formula for 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{a}^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 that can be used directly in the coordinate system 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \tilde{x}^{\mu}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 The solution of the problem is evident from Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:umu incorrect}

\begin_inset Formula \[
\tilde{a}^{\mu}=\frac{d\tilde{u}^{\mu}}{d\tau}-u^{\nu}\frac{d}{d\tau}\left(\frac{\partial f^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\nu}}\right).\]

\end_inset

Here, 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{\nu}$
\end_inset

 can be expressed through 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{u}^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 using Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:new u a}

\end_inset

).
 Therefore, the 4-acceleration 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{a}^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 in a curved coordinate system can be computed from 
\begin_inset Formula $d\tilde{u}^{\mu}/d\tau$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{u}^{\mu}$

\begin_inset Formula $f^{\mu}(x^{\nu})$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu=0,1,2,3$
\end_inset

, that relate the curved coordinates to the flat ones.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $d/d\tau$
\end_inset

 is effectively a derivative in the direction of the 4-velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 and can be applied to arbitrary functions of coordinates as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{d}{d\tau}\left(...\right)=u^{\lambda}\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\lambda}}\left(...\right).\]

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $f^{\mu}$

 are functions of

 (not of

\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{d}{d\tau}\left(\frac{\partial f^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\nu}}\right)=u^{\lambda}\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\lambda}}\left(\frac{\partial f^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\nu}}\right).\]

\end_inset

Therefore, we can compute the derivative of a vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{\mu}(x)$
\end_inset

 in the direction 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 in any coordinate system: in flat coordinates

 as
\begin_inset Formula \[

It is straightforward to see that the three-dimensional components

 The scalar product of two tangent vectors

After a short calculation with the functions

\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{v}=s_{1}t_{1}+\left(\sin^{2}\theta\right)s_{2}t_{2}.\]

Thus the induced metric on the sphere (in coordinates

 Then the flat coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ X^{\mu}\right\} $

 and the flat metric

 are available in the bulk, and the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}$

 defined within the manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$

 is equal to the induced metric with respect to the embedding into the bulk.
 A vector field defined within the manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 is visualized as a field of vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{\mu}(x)$

 everywhere tangent to the surface.
 We can compute the derivative of a tangent vector 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{\mu}$

 with respect to a tangent direction 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{\lambda}\partial A^{\mu}/\partial X^{\lambda}$
\end_inset

, but this vector may have a nonzero component normal to the surface.
 If we simply discard this component, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
if we project the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{\lambda}\partial A^{\mu}/\partial X^{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 orthogonally onto the surface, we obtain a vector tangent to the surface.
 Let us denote this vector by 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{\lambda}\nabla_{\lambda}A^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 (this notation is justified since the projection of 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{\lambda}\partial A^{\mu}/\partial X^{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 is linear in 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{\lambda}$
\end_inset

).
 The tensor

covariant derivative
\series default
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{covariant derivative}

of the vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{\mu}$

.
 Thus we have obtained a derivative operation 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 defined on tangent vectors within the manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly, the covariant derivative is defined on arbitrary tensors.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The procedure we employed to define the covariant derivative involves the
 orthogonal projection of 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial A^{\mu}/\partial X^{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 onto the tangent space of the hypersurface 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

.
 It may be unclear why it is useful to apply such a projection rather than
 some other operation.
 One can motivate this procedure by the following considerations.
 Imagine that a massive body is constrained to move without friction along
 a hypersurface 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

, while no other forces influence its motion.
 Further, imagine that the motion of the body is observed by a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

flat
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 observer who lives entirely within the hypersurface and thus cannot see
 the extra dimensions.
 To the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

flat
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 observer, such a body appears to be unforced because the constraining force
 normal to the surface is invisible.
 Therefore, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

flat
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 observer expects that the acceleration of the body, as seen from within
 the hypersurface, is equal to zero.
 Since the force acting on the body is always normal to the hypersurface,
 indeed the 
\emph on
tangential
\emph default
 components of the acceleration are always zero (but not the normal component).
 Therefore, the orthogonal projection of the acceleration onto the tangent
 space is always zero.
 This condition is equivalent to saying that the covariant derivative of
 the velocity vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 in the direction of motion is equal to zero, 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{\lambda}\nabla_{\lambda}u^{\mu}=0$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, the construction of the covariant derivative through the orthogonal
 projection indeed expresses the idea that the velocity of a freely moving
 body remains constant along the trajectory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the normal projection is constructed through the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 and depends on the embedding of the hypersurface 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 into the flat space.
 However, the derivative operation can be written solely in terms of intrinsic
 coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x^{\mu}\right\} $
\end_inset

 within the manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 and the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}$

, without referring to any embedding into a larger space.
 The derivation is standard and somewhat lengthy, so we omit it.

 As before, the numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{\alpha\nu}^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 depend on the coordinate system in such a way that the sum 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial u^{\mu}/\partial x^{\nu}+\Gamma_{\alpha\nu}^{\mu}u^{\nu}$
\end_inset

 transforms correctly as a rank (1,1) tensor under an arbitrary change of
 coordinates, even though the two terms 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{\nu}u^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{\alpha\nu}^{\mu}u^{\nu}$
\end_inset

, taken separately, do not transform correctly.
 The required transformation law for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{\alpha\nu}^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 is easy to derive.
 Let us temporarily write 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\nabla}$
\end_inset

 with a tilde when the covariant derivative is computed in the coordinate
 system 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \tilde{x}^{\mu}\right\} $
\end_inset

 (this is only for clarity; normally we do not use such a notation).
 We assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\nu}u^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 obeys the transformation law for rank (1,1) tensors,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\nabla_{\nu}u^{\mu}=\left(\tilde{\nabla}_{\alpha}\tilde{u}^{\beta}\right)\frac{\partial x^{\mu}}{\partial\tilde{x}^{\beta}}\frac{\partial\tilde{x}^{\alpha}}{\partial x^{\nu}},\]

\end_inset

and substitute 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\nabla_{\nu}u^{\mu} & \equiv\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\nu}}u^{\mu}+\Gamma_{\alpha\nu}^{\mu}u^{\alpha},\\
\tilde{\nabla}_{\nu}\tilde{u}^{\mu} & \equiv\frac{\partial}{\partial\tilde{x}^{\nu}}\tilde{u}^{\mu}+\tilde{\Gamma}_{\alpha\nu}^{\mu}\tilde{u}^{\alpha}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

The result is 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\lambda}=\tilde{\Gamma}_{\nu\rho}^{\mu}\frac{\partial\tilde{x}^{\nu}}{\partial x^{\alpha}}\frac{\partial\tilde{x}^{\rho}}{\partial x^{\beta}}\frac{\partial x^{\lambda}}{\partial\tilde{x}^{\mu}}+\frac{\partial^{2}x^{\lambda}}{\partial\tilde{x}^{\nu}\partial\tilde{x}^{\rho}}\frac{\partial\tilde{x}^{\nu}}{\partial x^{\alpha}}\frac{\partial\tilde{x}^{\rho}}{\partial x^{\beta}}.\label{eq:Gamma transformation law}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 The above transformation law contains a term that is not proportional to
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\lambda}$
\end_inset

, so the numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 may all vanish in one coordinate system but become nonzero in another.

Properties of covariant derivative

\begin_layout Standard
As defined above by Eq.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 produces tensors of rank (1,1) out of vectors.
 Despite an extra term in the formula\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:covariant derivative of vectors}

\end_inset

), the derivative satisfies the usual properties, such as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\nabla_{\lambda}\left(fA^{\mu}\right)=f\nabla_{\lambda}A^{\mu}+A^{\mu}\nabla_{\lambda}f,\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is a scalar function and 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 is a vector field.
 This is to be expected since 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\nu}$
\end_inset

 can be thought of as merely the standard derivative operator recalculated
 in a curved coordinate system.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\lambda}f\equiv\partial f/\partial x^{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 is an ordinary derivative, but no harm is done by writing 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\lambda}f$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{\lambda}f$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the derivative operation 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 is a projection of the ordinary directional derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial/\partial X^{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 in the embedding space, it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 satisfies the standard properties of a derivative, such as linearity,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\nabla_{\lambda}\left(A_{....}^{,,,,}+B_{....}^{,,,,}\right)=\nabla_{\lambda}A_{....}^{,,,,}+\nabla_{\lambda}B_{....}^{,,,,},\]

\end_inset

 and the Leibnitz rule, for instance
\begin_inset Formula \[
\nabla_{\lambda}(a_{\mu}^{\alpha}b^{\beta\gamma})=\left(\nabla_{\lambda}a_{\mu}^{\alpha}\right)b^{\beta\gamma}+a_{\mu}^{\alpha}\left(\nabla_{\lambda}b^{\beta\gamma}\right).\]

\end_inset

 Using this property, a generalization of the formula\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:covariant derivative of vectors}

\end_inset

) can be easily found for covectors or arbitrary tensors.
 In particular, we demand that
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\nabla_{\nu}\left(a^{\alpha}b^{\beta}\right) & =\left(\nabla_{\nu}a^{\alpha}\right)b^{\beta}+a^{\alpha}\left(\nabla_{\nu}b^{\beta}\right),\\
\nabla_{\nu}\left(x^{\alpha}y_{\alpha}\right) & =\partial_{\nu}\left(x^{\alpha}y_{\alpha}\right).\end{align*}

\end_inset

 From this we can derive an explicit formula for the covariant derivative
 for an arbitrary tensor, in terms of coordinate derivatives 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 and the Christoffel symbol.
 For example,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\nabla_{\nu}a_{\mu} & =\partial_{\nu}a_{\mu}-\Gamma_{\nu\mu}^{\lambda}a_{\lambda},\\
\nabla_{\nu}T_{\beta}^{\alpha} & =\partial_{\nu}T_{\beta}^{\alpha}+\Gamma_{\mu\nu}^{\alpha}T_{\beta}^{\mu}-\Gamma_{\nu\beta}^{\lambda}T_{\lambda}^{\alpha}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

For brevity, partial derivatives with respect to a coordinate are often
 denoted by an index with a preceding comma,
\begin_inset Formula \[

 So far, all we have achieved is a rewriting of the known physical laws
 in an arbitrary coordinate system; no new physical information is introduced

 is obtained from the known laws in Special Relativity by substituting an
 arbitrary (but nondegenerate and Lorentzian-signature) spacetime-dependent
 metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}(x)$
\end_inset

 instead of the flat Minkowski metric 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 and by replacing derivatives 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{\mu}$
\end_inset

 by covariant derivatives 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mu}$
\end_inset

, where the Christoffel symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 is defined by Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Christoffel symbol def}

\end_inset

).
 This step of course leads to certain changes in the physical laws due to
 a different 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 and a nontrivial 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\lambda}$
\end_inset

; these changes are interpreted as the influence of gravitation.
 The result is a reformulation of all the laws of physics in an arbitrary
 curved spacetime.
 This is, of course, a major assumption about the way gravitation affects
 the behavior of particles and fields: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

gravitation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is not a special force but the natural and inavoidable influence of the
 nontrivial geometry on matter in a curved spacetime.
 Ultimately, this statement must be tested by experiments.
 The experimental status of General Relativity is quite satisfactory at
 present.
 The widespread acceptance of GR is due to the experimental confirmation
 as well as to the simplicity of this theory compared with other theories
 of gravitation.

\begin_layout Standard
We have shown that the transformation law\InsetSpace ~

) can be derived merely from the requirement that 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\nu}A^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 should transform as a tensor of rank (1,1).
 It follows that 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 connection 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 that transforms according to Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Gamma transformation law}

\end_inset

) will give rise to a tensor 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{\partial A^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\beta}}+\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\mu}A^{\alpha}.\]

\end_inset

 So one may consider

alternative
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 covariant derivatives of the form\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:covariant derivative of vectors}

\end_inset

), where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 is not necessarily the Christoffel connection.
 Since the physical influence of gravity is described by terms containing
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\mu}$
\end_inset

, a natural question is to decide which connection 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

correct.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Standard
In GR, one chooses the Christoffel symbol\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Christoffel symbol def}

\end_inset

) as the connection.
 This can be justified on the basis of experimental data confirming GR,
 and also by considerations of mathematical simplicity.
 In fact, the choice\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Christoffel symbol def}

\end_inset

) is equivalent to the following two conditions: (i) 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\lambda}=\Gamma_{\beta\alpha}^{\lambda}$
\end_inset

, and (ii) 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\alpha\beta;\nu}=0$
\end_inset

 Let us review various arguments supporting these assumptions.

 Theories similar to GR but with

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $g_{\alpha\beta;\nu}\neq0$
\end_inset

 can be constructed as well.
 Although such theories are of course more complicated than GR, physicists
 do consider their physical consequences and test them experimentally.
 So far, no alternative theory of gravitation has been shown to surpass
 GR in correct experimental predictions.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The condition (i) can be seen as a consequence of the equivalence principle,
 which says that each event 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 admits a locally inertial frame where Special Relativity holds in an infinitesi
mal neighborhood of 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, there exists a coordinate system 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 in which the physical laws hold with ordinary derivatives 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial/\partial x^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mu}$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, at the event 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\lambda}(p)=0$
\end_inset

.
 Recalculating 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 for other reference frames using Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Gamma transformation law}

\end_inset

), we find that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\lambda}(p)=\Gamma_{\beta\alpha}^{\lambda}(p)$
\end_inset

 in 
\emph on
every
\emph default
 reference frame.
 Since this argument holds for any event 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

, we find that the equivalence principle entails the condition 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\lambda}=\Gamma_{\beta\alpha}^{\lambda}$
\end_inset

.
 Alternatively, we may demand that the covariant derivatives commute on
 functions, i.e.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset Formula $f_{;\mu\nu}=f_{;\nu\mu}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is any scalar function.
 It can be easily seen that this condition also forces 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\lambda}=\Gamma_{\beta\alpha}^{\lambda}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The condition (ii) is another fundamental assumption that can be motivated
 in many ways.
 For instance, 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 in the Minkowski spacetime is given by a constant matrix, 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}=\eta_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

, thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{\alpha}g_{\mu\nu}=0$
\end_inset

, while we expect that the same property (but involving the covariant derivative
) should hold in curved spacetimes.
 Alternatively, we may require that the operation of lowering an index of
 a vector or a tensor should commute with the covariant derivative:
\begin_inset Formula \[
g_{\mu\alpha}A^{\mu}{}_{;\nu}=\left(A_{\alpha}\right)_{;\nu},\quad\textrm{where }A_{\alpha}\equiv A^{\mu}g_{\mu\alpha}.\]

\end_inset

This property is clearly equivalent to 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{;\nu}^{\mu\alpha}=0$
\end_inset

.
 Alternatively, let us consider the properties of a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

locally constant
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 vector field.
 A vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

locally constant
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 if its covariant derivative vanishes at a point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

, i.e.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset Formula $u_{;\nu}^{\mu}(p)=0$
\end_inset

.
 (In a locally inertial frame at 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

, this condition is identical to 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{\nu}u^{\mu}(p)=0$
\end_inset

.) If the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

constant
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in this sense, it is natural to expect that the length of the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 is also locally constant: 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\alpha}(g_{\mu\nu}u^{\mu}u^{\nu})|_{p}=0$
\end_inset

.
 However, this condition is equivalent to 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu;\alpha}u^{\mu}u^{\nu}=0$
\end_inset

.
 Since the direction 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 and the point  
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 are arbitrary, we must require that 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu;\alpha}=0$
\end_inset

 everywhere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is a straightforward exercise to derive an explicit form of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 from the conditions (i) and (ii), and we omit the derivation (which can
 be found in standard textbooks).
 The result is the formula\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Christoffel symbol def}

\end_inset

).
 Thus the intrinsic metric 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 uniquely defines the Christoffel symbol and the covariant derivative.
 In General Relativity, one never uses any other connection than the Christoffel
 symbol given above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Remark:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The constancy of the metric under the covariant derivative, 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\lambda}g_{\mu\nu}=0$
\end_inset

, is a direct consequence of the construction of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 through a projection from an embedding of the manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 as a hypersurface in a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

bulk
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 space with coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $X^{\lambda}$
\end_inset

.
 Since the bulk has a flat metric 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{\lambda}G_{\mu\nu}=0$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{\lambda}\equiv\partial/\partial X^{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 is the derivative with respect to the flat coodinates in the bulk.
 Suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 are two tangent vector fields; then by definition of the induced metric,
 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}u^{\mu}v^{\nu}=G_{\mu\nu}u^{\mu}v^{\nu}$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\partial_{\lambda}\left(G_{\mu\nu}u^{\mu}v^{\nu}\right)=G_{\mu\nu}\left(\partial_{\lambda}u^{\mu}\right)v^{\nu}+G_{\mu\nu}u^{\mu}\left(\partial_{\lambda}v^{\nu}\right).\]

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 are tangent, the normal component of 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{\lambda}u^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 will disappear from the scalar product 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{\mu\nu}\left(\partial_{\lambda}u^{\mu}\right)v^{\nu}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus
\begin_inset Formula \[
\partial_{\lambda}\left(G_{\mu\nu}u^{\mu}v^{\nu}\right)=g_{\mu\nu}\left(\nabla_{\lambda}u^{\mu}\right)v^{\nu}+g_{\mu\nu}u^{\mu}\left(\nabla_{\lambda}v^{\nu}\right).\]

\end_inset

On the other hand,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\partial_{\lambda}\left(G_{\mu\nu}u^{\mu}v^{\nu}\right)=\nabla_{\lambda}\left(g_{\mu\nu}u^{\mu}v^{\nu}\right),\]

\end_inset

and it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\lambda}g_{\mu\nu}=0$
\end_inset

.

Parallel transport
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The concept of parallel transport of vectors on a curved manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 can be easily visualized if we think of the manifold 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}$
\end_inset

 as a surface embedded in flat space.
 Suppose a path is given within the surface, with a tangent vector 
\begin_inset Formula $v^{\mu}$
\end_inset

.
 An arbitrary tangent vector 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 can be transported along the path in such a way that the derivative along
 the path in the bulk space, 
\begin_inset Formula $v^{\lambda}\partial u^{\mu}/\partial X^{\lambda}$
\end_inset

, is everywhere normal to the surface.
 Since (by definition) 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial/\partial X^{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 projected onto the tangent plane, the condition 
\begin_inset Formula $v^{\lambda}\partial u^{\mu}/\partial X^{\lambda}=0$
\end_inset

 is equivalent to the condition 
\begin_inset Formula $v^{\lambda}\nabla_{\lambda}u^{\mu}=0$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This motivates the following definition: A vector 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 is 
\series bold
parallelly transported 
\series default

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{parallel transport}

\end_inset

along a path if 
\begin_inset Formula $v^{\lambda}\nabla_{\lambda}u^{\mu}=0$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $v^{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 is a tangent vector to the path.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The covariant derivative can then be given a different interpretation using
 the parallel transport operation.
 Let us denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{T}_{\varepsilon\mathbf{a}}u^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 the parallel transport of a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 along a straight line segment 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon a^{\mu}$
\end_inset

.
 Then we can say that the covariant derivative measures the rate of change
 in the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 compared with the change due to the parallel transport: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
a^{\lambda}\nabla_{\lambda}u^{\mu}=\lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow0}\frac{u(x^{\mu}+\varepsilon a^{\mu})-\hat{T}_{\varepsilon\mathbf{a}}u(x^{\mu})}{\varepsilon}.\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is easy to see that the scalar product of vectors is constant under a
 parallel transport:
\begin_inset Formula \[
v^{\lambda}\nabla_{\lambda}\left(g_{\mu\nu}u^{\mu}w^{\nu}\right)=0\;\textrm{if }v^{\lambda}\nabla_{\lambda}u^{\mu}=v^{\lambda}\nabla_{\lambda}w^{\mu}=0.\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that in flat space we may introduce flat coordinates where we have
 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\lambda}=\partial_{\lambda}$
\end_inset

, and thus a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 is parallelly transported along any curve iff all the components 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 remain constant.
 If we use 
\emph on
curved
\emph default
 coordinates in flat space, the components of a vector may change during
 a parallel transport because the directions of the basis vectors change
 in space.
 However, if we execute a parallel transport of a vector along a 
\emph on

 path, the components of the vector will return to their initial values.

 In other words,

\begin_layout Standard
In flat space, the operation of parallel transport along a closed path does
 not change any vectors.
 However, in a curved manifold, this is no longer true; e.g., on a spherical
 surface, a parallel transport of a vector along a spherical triangle will
 generally rotate the vector.
 The

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 parallelly transported along a closed path 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 will undergo a linear transformation (a rotation and a dilation).
 We may describe this transformation by a matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{T}_{\nu}^{\mu}(\gamma)$
\end_inset

, so that the new vector is expressed as 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{u}^{\mu}=\hat{T}_{\nu}^{\mu}(\gamma)u^{\nu}$
\end_inset

.
 In flat space, parallel transport along a closed path will not change any
 vectors (even in curved coordinates!) and thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{T}_{\nu}^{\mu}(\gamma)\equiv\delta_{\nu}^{\mu}$
\end_inset

.
 In the general case, the dependence of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{T}_{\nu}^{\mu}(\gamma)$
\end_inset

 on the path 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 is complicated but can be simplified if we consider 
\emph on
infinitesimally small
\emph default
 closed paths.
 A simple example of such a path is a parallelogram spanned by two vectors
 
\begin_inset Formula $a^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 with sides 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon a^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon b^{\mu}$
\end_inset

.
 One can compute the change in the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 after a parallel transport along the parallelogram (see the calculation
 below).
 The result is
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tilde{u}^{\mu}=u^{\mu}+\varepsilon^{2}R_{\;\lambda\alpha\beta}^{\mu}u^{\lambda}a^{\alpha}b^{\beta},\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{\alpha\beta\lambda}^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 is called the

\end_inset

Note that the Christoffel symbol involves first derivatives of the metric

We will compute the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{T}_{\nu}^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 that performs the parallel transport of a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 along a closed parallelogram with vertices 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{(0)}^{\mu}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{(1)}^{\mu}\equiv x_{(0)}^{\mu}+\varepsilon a^{\mu}$

\begin_inset Formula $x_{(2)}^{\mu}\equiv x_{(0)}^{\mu}+\varepsilon(a^{\mu}+b^{\mu})$

\begin_inset Formula $x_{(3)}^{\mu}\equiv x_{(0)}^{\mu}+\varepsilon b^{\mu}$

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{(0)}^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 is an arbitrary point in spacetime and 
\begin_inset Formula $a^{\mu},b^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 are arbitrary vectors.
 The matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{T}_{\nu}^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 describes the change in vectors as a result of the parallel transport as
 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{u}^{\mu}=\hat{T}_{\nu}^{\mu}u^{\nu}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The calculations are performed in an arbitrary coordinate system covering
 the entire parallelogram.
 For brevity, we omit the indices on coordinates of points and write simply
 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{(0)}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $x_{(0)}+\varepsilon a$
\end_inset

, etc., instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{(0)}^{\mu}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $x_{(0)}^{\mu}+\varepsilon a^{\mu}$

 Let us denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\nu}^{\mu}(x;\varepsilon a)$
\end_inset

 the parallel transport matrix between points 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x+\varepsilon a$
\end_inset

 Then the total transport matrix will be expressed as the (matrix) product
 of the transport matrices computed for the four individual segments:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{T}_{\nu}^{\mu}=T_{\alpha}^{\mu}(x_{(3)};-\varepsilon b)T_{\beta}^{\alpha}(x_{(2)};-\varepsilon a)T_{\gamma}^{\beta}(x_{(1)};\varepsilon b)T_{\nu}^{\gamma}(x_{(0)};\varepsilon a).\]

\end_inset

 Since we are only interested in considering an infinitesimally small parallelog
ram, the required value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 will be small, so we need to find 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\nu}^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 only up to a certain order in 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

.
 In the course of the calculation it will become clear that only terms up
 to and including 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon^{2}$
\end_inset

 are relevant.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We begin by considering the parallel transport along the segment 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{(0)}\rightarrow x_{(0)}+\varepsilon a$
\end_inset

.
 The parallel-transported vector 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\nu}^{\mu}(x_{(0)};\varepsilon a)u^{\nu}$
\end_inset

 can be thought of as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

, which we temporarily denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{\mu}(\varepsilon)$
\end_inset

.
 By construction, the derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $a^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}$
\end_inset

 is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $d/d\varepsilon$
\end_inset

, and therefore the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{\mu}(\varepsilon)$
\end_inset

 satisfies the differential equation 
\begin_inset Formula \[
0=a^{\mu}\nabla_{\mu}u^{\nu}=\frac{du^{\nu}(\varepsilon)}{d\varepsilon}+a^{\mu}u^{\alpha}(\varepsilon)\Gamma_{\alpha\mu}^{\nu}(x_{(0)}+\varepsilon a).\]

\end_inset

Here we explicitly indicated the point, 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{(0)}+\varepsilon a$
\end_inset

, where the Christoffel symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 is evaluated.
 Hence, the parallel transport operator 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\nu}^{\mu}(x_{(0)};\varepsilon a)$
\end_inset

 satisfies the equation
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\frac{d}{d\varepsilon}T_{\nu}^{\mu}(x_{(0)};\varepsilon a)+a^{\lambda}\Gamma_{\alpha\lambda}^{\mu}(x_{(0)}+\varepsilon a)T_{\nu}^{\alpha}(x_{(0)};\varepsilon a)=0,\label{eq:par trans equ}\end{equation}

\end_inset

with the initial condition 
\begin_inset Formula $\left.T_{\nu}^{\mu}\right|_{\varepsilon=0}=\delta_{\nu}^{\mu}$

\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
T_{\nu}^{\mu}(x_{(0)};\varepsilon a)=\delta_{\nu}^{\mu}-\varepsilon a^{\lambda}\Gamma_{\nu\lambda}^{\mu}(x_{(0)})+O(\varepsilon^{2}),\label{eq:1st order sol}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{\nu\lambda}^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 may be computed at 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{(0)}$
\end_inset

 since the variation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 across the parallelogram is of order 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 and we are disregarding 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 The other transport operators (
\begin_inset Formula $T_{\nu}^{\mu}(x_{(1)};\varepsilon b)$
\end_inset

, etc.) are found by the same method.
 Combining the four operators, we obtain
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
T_{\nu}^{\mu} & =\delta_{\nu}^{\mu}-\varepsilon\left(a^{\lambda}+b^{\lambda}-a^{\lambda}-b^{\lambda}\right)\Gamma_{\nu\lambda}^{\mu}(x_{(0)})+O(\varepsilon^{2})\\
 & =\delta_{\nu}^{\mu}+O(\varepsilon^{2}).\end{align*}

\end_inset

It is clear that the current precision is insufficient to describe the change
 in vectors due to parallel transport.
 Thus, we need to compute second-order terms.

\begin_layout Standard
Now it is necessary to take into account the variation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 across the parallelogram.
 To this end, we expand 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 in Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:par trans equ}

\end_inset

) as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\Gamma_{\alpha\lambda}^{\mu}(x_{(0)}+\varepsilon a)=\Gamma_{\alpha\lambda}^{\mu}(x_{(0)})+\varepsilon a^{\beta}\partial_{\beta}\Gamma_{\alpha\lambda}^{\mu}(x_{(0)}).\label{eq:Gamma expand}\end{equation}

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 is always multiplied by 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

, it is sufficient to retain terms of order 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 in Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Gamma expand}

\end_inset

).
 Let us also compress the notation by introducing the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma(a)\equiv\Gamma_{\nu\lambda}^{\mu}a^{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 and omitting the indices in matrix multiplications.
 Then Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:par trans equ}

\end_inset

) with the substitution\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Gamma expand}

\end_inset

) becomes
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\frac{d}{d\varepsilon}T+\left.\left(\Gamma(a)+\varepsilon a^{\beta}\partial_{\beta}\Gamma(a)\right)\right|_{x_{(0)}}T+O(\varepsilon^{2})=0,\label{eq:u par trans equ 2}\end{equation}

\end_inset

while the first-order solution\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:1st order sol}

\end_inset

) is written as
\begin_inset Formula \[
T(x_{(0)};\varepsilon a)=\hat{1}-\varepsilon\Gamma(a)+O(\varepsilon^{2}),\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{1}\equiv\delta_{\nu}^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 is the identity matrix.
 For the present purposes, it suffices to obtain a solution of Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:u par trans equ 2}

\end_inset

) to second order in 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore we consider the ansatz
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
T(x_{(0)};\varepsilon a)=\hat{1}-\left.\varepsilon\Gamma(a)\right|_{x_{(0)}}+\varepsilon^{2}U,\label{eq:u par trans sol 2 U}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the unknown matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $U\equiv U_{\nu}^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 is to be found, while the first-order term is copied from Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:1st order sol}

\end_inset

).
 Substituting Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:u par trans sol 2 U}

\end_inset

) into Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:u par trans equ 2}

\end_inset

), we find
\begin_inset Formula \[
U_{\nu}^{\mu}=\frac{1}{2}\left.\left(\Gamma(a)\Gamma(a)-a^{\lambda}\partial_{\lambda}\Gamma(a)\right)\right|_{x_{(0)}}.\]

\end_inset

The second-order solution is then 
\begin_inset Formula \[
T(x_{(0)};\varepsilon a)=\hat{1}+\left[-\varepsilon\Gamma(a)-\frac{\varepsilon^{2}}{2}\left(\Gamma(a)\Gamma(a)-a^{\lambda}\partial_{\lambda}\Gamma(a)\right)\right]_{x_{(0)}}.\]

\end_inset

Note that the second-order terms,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Gamma(b)\Gamma(b)-b^{\lambda}\partial_{\lambda}\Gamma(b),\]

\end_inset

 may be evaluated at any point, say at 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{(0)}$
\end_inset

, because the variation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 across the parallelogram is of order 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, we may simplify the above expression to
\begin_inset Formula \[
T(x_{(0)};\varepsilon a)=\hat{1}-\left.\varepsilon\Gamma(a)\right|_{x_{(0)}}+\frac{\varepsilon^{2}}{2}\left(\Gamma(a)\Gamma(a)-a^{\lambda}\partial_{\lambda}\Gamma(a)\right).\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the same method, we compute the matrix describing parallel transport
 from 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{(1)}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{(2)}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
T(x_{(1)};\varepsilon b)=\hat{1}-\left.\varepsilon\Gamma(b)\right|_{x_{(1)}}+\frac{\varepsilon^{2}}{2}\left(\Gamma(b)\Gamma(b)-b^{\lambda}\partial_{\lambda}\Gamma(b)\right),\]

\end_inset

and all the other parallel transport matrices.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we have to multiply the four transport matrices, preserving the
 order of matrix multiplications and discarding any terms of order 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon^{3}$
\end_inset

 or higher.
 Within first-order terms, we need to expand 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 to first order in 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

, e.g.
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left.\Gamma(b)\right|_{x_{(1)}}=\left.\Gamma(b)\right|_{x_{(0)}}+\varepsilon a^{\lambda}\left.\partial_{\lambda}\Gamma(b)\right|_{x_{(0)}},\]

\end_inset

so that
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\left.\Gamma(a)\right|_{x_{(2)}}-\left.\Gamma(a)\right|_{x_{(0)}} & =\varepsilon\left(a^{\lambda}+b^{\lambda}\right)\left.\partial_{\lambda}\Gamma(a)\right|_{x_{(0)}}+O(\varepsilon^{2}),\\
\left.\Gamma(b)\right|_{x_{(3)}}-\left.\Gamma(b)\right|_{x_{(1)}} & =\varepsilon\left(-a^{\lambda}+b^{\lambda}\right)\left.\partial_{\lambda}\Gamma(b)\right|_{x_{(0)}}+O(\varepsilon^{2}).\end{align*}

\end_inset

 Within second-order terms, we may evaluate all 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

's at 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{(0)}$
\end_inset

.
 After a straightforward calculation, we obtain
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\hat{T}=T(x_{(3)};-\varepsilon b)T(x_{(2)};-\varepsilon a) & T(x_{(1)};\varepsilon b)T(x_{(0)};\varepsilon a)\\
=\hat{1}-\left.\varepsilon\Gamma(a)\right|_{x_{(0)}}-\left.\varepsilon\Gamma(b)\right|_{x_{(1)}} & +\left.\varepsilon\Gamma(a)\right|_{x_{(2)}}+\left.\varepsilon\Gamma(b)\right|_{x_{(3)}}\\
+\varepsilon^{2}\big(\Gamma(b)\Gamma(a)-\Gamma(a)\Gamma(b) & -a^{\lambda}\partial_{\lambda}\Gamma(a)-b^{\lambda}\partial_{\lambda}\Gamma(b)\big)\\
=\hat{1}+\varepsilon^{2}\big(\Gamma(b)\Gamma(a)-\Gamma(a)\Gamma(b) & +b^{\lambda}\partial_{\lambda}\Gamma(a)-a^{\lambda}\partial_{\lambda}\Gamma(b)\big).\end{align*}

\end_inset

Restoring the full index notation, we can write the result as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\hat{T}_{\nu}^{\mu} & =\delta_{\nu}^{\mu}+\varepsilon^{2}R_{\;\nu\alpha\beta}^{\mu}a^{\alpha}b^{\beta},\\
R_{\;\nu\alpha\beta}^{\mu} & \equiv\partial_{\beta}\Gamma_{\nu\alpha}^{\mu}-\partial_{\alpha}\Gamma_{\nu\beta}^{\mu}+\Gamma_{\beta\lambda}^{\mu}\Gamma_{\alpha\nu}^{\lambda}-\Gamma_{\alpha\lambda}^{\mu}\Gamma_{\nu\beta}^{\lambda}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

The last line coincides with Eq.\InsetSpace ~

 This calculation shows that the Riemann tensor

Determinant of the metric
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An important object in GR is the determinant of the metric, usually denoted
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
g\equiv\det\left(g_{\mu\nu}\right).\]

\end_inset

It follows that the determinant of the contravariant metric is 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{-1}=\det\left(g^{\mu\nu}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Note that the function 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is a determinant of a (0,2)-tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 which not a scalar function but depends nontrivially on the coordinate
 system.
 For instance, given two coordinate systems 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x^{\mu}\right\} $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \tilde{x}^{\mu}\right\} $
\end_inset

, the corresponding components 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 of the metric are related by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g_{\mu\nu}\textrm{d}x^{\mu}\textrm{d}x^{\nu}=\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}\textrm{d}\tilde{x}^{\mu}\textrm{d}\tilde{x}^{\nu},\]

\end_inset

which can be rewritten in the matrix notation (temporarily using capital
 letters to denote the matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $G\equiv g_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $S\equiv\partial\tilde{x}^{\mu}/\partial x^{\nu}$
\end_inset

) as
\begin_inset Formula \[
G=S^{T}\tilde{G}S.\]

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\det A^{T}=\det A$
\end_inset

 for any matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, we find 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\frac{\det g_{\mu\nu}}{\det\tilde{g}_{\mu\nu}}=\left(\det\frac{\partial\tilde{x}^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\nu}}\right)^{2}.\label{eq:det gmn transformation law}\end{equation}

\end_inset

It is clear that the metric determinant is a coordinate system-dependent
 quantity.

\begin_layout Subsection
Covariant volume element
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The determinant of the metric is used most frequently to express integration
 over the manifold in a covariant way, such that functions can be integrated
 in arbitrary coordinate systems.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose we would like to integrate a scalar function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 over a region of the spacetime manifold.
 The ordinary formula 
\begin_inset Formula $\int d^{4}x\, f(x)$
\end_inset

 is good in flat (Cartesian) coordinates but unsatisfactory in curved coordinate
s.
 Namely, a different choice of coordinates, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \tilde{x}^{\mu}\right\} $
\end_inset

, will generally yield a different result,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int\textrm{d}^{4}\tilde{x}\, f(\tilde{x})=\int\textrm{d}^{4}x\, f(x)\det\left[\frac{\partial\tilde{x}^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\nu}}\right]\neq\int\textrm{d}^{4}x\, f(x),\]

\end_inset

unless the Jacobian happens to be equal to 1, 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\left[\partial\tilde{x}^{\mu}/\partial x^{\nu}\right]=1$
\end_inset

, which is certainly a very special case.
 The problem is that we have a formula, 
\begin_inset Formula $\int\textrm{d}^{4}x\, f(x)$
\end_inset

, that works only in flat coordinates.
 The solution is to write all the integrals using the 
\series bold
covariant volume element
\series default
,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{d}^{4}V\equiv\textrm{d}^{4}x\sqrt{-g(x)},\]

\end_inset

instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}^{4}x$
\end_inset

.
 Because of the transformation law\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:det gmn transformation law}

\end_inset

), it is clear that the covariant formula for the integral of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int\textrm{d}^{4}x\sqrt{-g(x)}f(x),\]

\end_inset

yields the same answer in every coordinate system, including flat coordinate
 systems where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{-g(x)}\equiv1$
\end_inset

 (if such coordinate systems exist).

\begin_layout Subsection
Derivative of the determinant
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is often necessary to compute derivatives of the metric determinant,
 for instance 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{\mu}\sqrt{-g}$
\end_inset

.
 Such derivatives can be easily expressed through 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to derive this expression, we use a general formula for the derivative
 of the determinant of a (nondegenerate) matrix:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\frac{d}{dt}\left[\det A(t)\right]=\textrm{Tr}\left(A^{-1}\frac{d}{dt}A(t)\right)\det A(t).\label{eq:matrix id 1}\end{equation}

\end_inset

This formula can be found quickly from the matrix identity
\begin_inset Formula \[
\det e^{X}=e^{\textrm{Tr }X},\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 is an arbitrary matrix, after a substitution 
\begin_inset Formula $A\equiv e^{X}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:matrix id 1}

\end_inset

), we find, in particular, 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
\partial_{\mu}g & =\left[g^{\alpha\beta}\partial_{\mu}g_{\alpha\beta}\right]g,\nonumber \\
\partial_{\mu}\sqrt{-g} & =\left[g^{\alpha\beta}\partial_{\mu}g_{\alpha\beta}\right]\frac{\sqrt{-g}}{2}.\label{eq:deriv sqrt minus g}\end{align}

\begin_layout Standard
Divergence of a vector field,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{div }\mathbf{a}\equiv\nabla_{\mu}a^{\mu}\equiv a^{\mu}{}_{;\mu},\]

\end_inset

 is an important special case where the covariant formula for the derivative
 is simpler than in the general form.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using Eqs.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:covariant derivative of vectors}

\end_inset

)-(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Christoffel symbol def}

\end_inset

), we find
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\nabla_{\mu}a^{\mu} & =\partial_{\mu}a^{\mu}+\Gamma_{\mu\nu}^{\mu}a^{\nu};\\
\Gamma_{\mu\nu}^{\mu} & =\frac{1}{2}g^{\mu\alpha}\left(g_{\alpha\mu,\nu}+g_{\alpha\nu,\mu}-g_{\mu\nu,\alpha}\right)=\frac{1}{2}g^{\mu\alpha}g_{\mu\alpha,\nu}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Comparing the right-hand side in the last line with Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:deriv sqrt minus g}

\end_inset

), we obtain
\begin_inset Formula \[
\Gamma_{\mu\nu}^{\mu}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{-g}}\partial_{\nu}\sqrt{-g}\]

\end_inset

and hence
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\nabla_{\mu}a^{\mu}=\partial_{\mu}a^{\mu}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{-g}}a^{\nu}\partial_{\mu}\sqrt{-g}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{-g}}\partial_{\nu}\left[\sqrt{-g}a^{\nu}\right].\label{eq:cov divergence}\end{equation}

\end_inset

This simple formula is useful because it does not require computing the
 full set of Christoffel symbols.

\begin_layout Subsection
Integration by parts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In field theory, one often needs to integrate by parts using the Gauss theorem
 for volume integrals, for instance,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\int_{V}\textrm{d}^{4}x\,\partial_{\mu}u^{\mu}=\oint_{\Sigma}\textrm{d}^{3}A_{\mu}u^{\mu},\label{eq:Gauss flat}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 is a 4-dimensional region where a vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 is defined, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 is the boundary 3-surface of 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}^{3}A_{\mu}$
\end_inset

 is a directed 3-area element of the hypersurface 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

.
 However, the identity\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Gauss flat}

\end_inset

) is valid only if we use the same fixed coordinate system at both sides
 of the equation.
 We would like to have a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

covariant
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 formula such that both sides of the equation contain only 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

covariant
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 quantities that remain the same in any coordinate system.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To derive such a formula, we guess (heuristically) that the ordinary derivative
 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{\mu}u^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 must be replaced by the covariant derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mu}u^{\mu}$
\end_inset

, and the volume element 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}^{4}x$
\end_inset

 by the covariant volume element 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{d}^{4}x\sqrt{-g}$
\end_inset

.
 In flat space, these replacements do not modify the original expressions.
 Let us now verify that this replacement indeed yields the correct results.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The left-hand side of Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Gauss flat}

\end_inset

) is replaced by
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int_{V}\textrm{d}^{4}x\,\partial_{\mu}u^{\mu}\rightarrow\int_{V}\textrm{d}^{4}x\sqrt{-g}\,\nabla_{\mu}u^{\mu}.\]

\end_inset

This expression stays the same in every coordinate system.
 Using Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:cov divergence}

\end_inset

), we find 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int_{V}\textrm{d}^{4}x\sqrt{-g}\,\nabla_{\mu}u^{\mu}=\int_{V}\textrm{d}^{4}x\,\partial_{\mu}\left[\sqrt{-g}u^{\mu}\right].\]

\end_inset

The above equation is valid in any coordinate system; choosing some coordinate
 system, we may use Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Gauss flat}

\end_inset

) and obtain (still in the same fixed coordinate system)
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int_{V}\textrm{d}^{4}x\,\partial_{\mu}\left[\sqrt{-g}u^{\mu}\right]=\oint_{\Sigma}\textrm{d}^{3}A_{\mu}\sqrt{-g}u^{\mu}.\]

\end_inset

The expression on the right-hand side is interpreted as the integral of
 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 over the covariant area element 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{-g}\textrm{d}^{3}A_{\mu}$
\end_inset

.
 This expression is the same in every coordinate system.
 Therefore, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

covariant Gauss theorem
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is written as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int_{V}\textrm{d}^{4}x\sqrt{-g}\,\nabla_{\mu}u^{\mu}=\oint_{\Sigma}\textrm{d}^{3}A_{\mu}\sqrt{-g}u^{\mu}.\]

So far we considered vectors and tensors in Euclidean coordinates, but now

 itself is not a vector any more because the coordinates are not rectangular.
 However, an infinitesimal displacement

 To verify this, we consider an arbitrary change of coordinates described

\begin_inset Formula \[
x^{\mu}\rightarrow\tilde{x}^{\mu}=\tilde{x}^{\mu}(x^{\nu}).\]

Then the displacement

 transforms as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\delta\tilde{x}^{\mu}=\frac{\partial\tilde{x}^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\nu}}\delta x^{\nu},\]

An important operation of tensor calculus is the covariant derivative.
 First, observe that a partial derivative of a contravariant vector field,
 
\begin_inset Formula $v^{\mu}{}_{,\nu}\equiv\partial v^{\mu}/\partial x^{\nu}$
\end_inset

 does not transform as a tensor of rank (1,1).
 To get a derivative that transforms correctly, one adds a suitable 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 term and thus defines the 
\series bold
covariant derivative
\series default

\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
v^{\mu}{}_{;\nu}\equiv\frac{\partial v^{\mu}}{\partial x^{\nu}}+\Gamma_{\alpha\nu}^{\mu}v^{\alpha},\label{eq:covariant der gamma}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the set of quantities 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 is called the 
\series bold
Christoffel symbol
\series default
.
 It can be verified by a direct calculation that the covariant derivative
 
\begin_inset Formula $v^{\mu}{}_{;\nu}$
\end_inset

 defined by Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:covariant der gamma}

\end_inset

 transforms as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\lambda}=\tilde{\Gamma}_{\nu\rho}^{\mu}\frac{\partial\tilde{x}^{\nu}}{\partial x^{\alpha}}\frac{\partial\tilde{x}^{\rho}}{\partial x^{\beta}}\frac{\partial x^{\lambda}}{\partial\tilde{x}^{\mu}}+\frac{\partial^{2}x^{\lambda}}{\partial\tilde{x}^{\nu}\partial\tilde{x}^{\rho}}\frac{\partial\tilde{x}^{\nu}}{\partial x^{\alpha}}\frac{\partial\tilde{x}^{\rho}}{\partial x^{\beta}}.\label{eq:Christoffel transform}\end{equation}

\end_inset

Therefore, we require that the transformation law\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Christoffel transform}

\end_inset

) holds for the Christoffel symbol.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 is not a tensor, and a suitable change of coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x^{\mu}\right\} \rightarrow\left\{ \tilde{x}^{\mu}\right\} $
\end_inset

 can make 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\lambda}=0$
\end_inset

 at any point.
 Such coordinates are called an 
\series bold
inertial coordinate system
\series default
 at that point.
 However, 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\lambda}-\Gamma_{\beta\alpha}^{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 is a tensor because the second term in Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Christoffel transform}

\end_inset

) drops out when we write the transformation law for 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\lambda}-\Gamma_{\beta\alpha}^{\lambda}$
\end_inset

.
 Since the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\lambda}-\Gamma_{\beta\alpha}^{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 vanishes in a locally inertial coordinate system, it vanishes in all coordinate
 systems, hence 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\lambda}$
\end_inset

 is symmetric in 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\alpha,\beta\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As shown in Eq.\InsetSpace ~

 vector is defined similarly by
\begin_inset Formula \[
v_{\mu;\nu}=\frac{\partial v_{\mu}}{\partial x^{\nu}}-\Gamma_{\mu\nu}^{\lambda}v_{\lambda}.\]

\end_inset

Then it can be shown that the covariant derivative of the scalar product
 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{\mu}b^{\mu}$
\end_inset

 coincides with the ordinary derivative, i.e.
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(a_{\mu}b^{\mu}\right)_{;\alpha}=a_{\mu;\alpha}b^{\mu}+a_{\mu}b^{\mu}{}_{;\alpha}=\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\alpha}}\left(a_{\mu}b^{\mu}\right).\]

\end_inset

This is, of course, to be expected for a scalar quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{\mu}b^{\mu}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since tensors are quantities that transform as products of vectors and covectors
, the covariant derivative can be defined on arbitrary tensors in a similar
 way.
 For each upper index there is a term with 
\begin_inset Formula $+\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\lambda}$
\end_inset

, and for each lower index a term with 
\begin_inset Formula $-\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\lambda}$
\end_inset

.
 For example,
\begin_inset Formula \[
A_{\gamma}^{\alpha\beta}{}_{;\mu}=\frac{\partial}{\partial x^{\mu}}A_{\gamma}^{\alpha\beta}+\Gamma_{\mu\nu}^{\alpha}A_{\gamma}^{\nu\beta}+\Gamma_{\mu\nu}^{\beta}A_{\gamma}^{\alpha\nu}-\Gamma_{\gamma\mu}^{\nu}A_{\nu}^{\alpha\beta}.\]

\end_inset

Then one can prove that the Leibnitz rule holds for arbitrary tensors,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(A^{\alpha\beta...}B^{\gamma\delta...}\right)_{;\mu}=A^{\alpha\beta...}{}_{;\mu}B^{\gamma\delta...}+A^{\alpha\beta...}B^{\gamma\delta...}{}_{;\mu}.\]

\end_inset

This expression can be derived from the property 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\lambda}=\Gamma_{\beta\alpha}^{\lambda}$
\end_inset

.
 To derive Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Gamma def 2}

\begin_inset Formula $g_{\mu\nu;\alpha}=0$
\end_inset

.
 For any vector 
\begin_inset Formula $X^{\beta}$
\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\alpha\beta}X^{\beta}=X_{\alpha}$
\end_inset

, hence
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
g_{\alpha\beta}\left(A^{\beta}\right)_{;\lambda}=\left(A_{\alpha}\right)_{;\lambda}\label{eq:derivative g sneaky}\end{equation}

\end_inset

and therefore
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\left(g_{\alpha\beta}A^{\beta}\right)_{;\lambda} & =g_{\alpha\beta;\lambda}A^{\beta}+g_{\alpha\beta}\left(A^{\beta}\right)_{;\lambda}\\
\Rightarrow & \quad g_{\alpha\beta;\lambda}A^{\beta}=0.\end{align*}

\end_inset

The required property 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{\alpha\beta;\lambda}=0$
\end_inset

 follows since 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{\beta}$
\end_inset

 is an arbitrary vector.
 Then it is a matter of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

juggling the indices
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to derive Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Gamma def 2}

\end_inset

).
 Namely, we write
\begin_inset Formula \[
0=g_{\alpha\beta;\lambda}=g_{\alpha\beta,\lambda}-\Gamma_{\alpha\lambda}^{\mu}g_{\beta\mu}-\Gamma_{\beta\lambda}^{\mu}g_{\alpha\mu},\]

\end_inset

then exchange indices 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha,\beta,\lambda$
\end_inset

 to get
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
0 & =g_{\alpha\lambda,\beta}-\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\mu}g_{\lambda\mu}-\Gamma_{\beta\lambda}^{\mu}g_{\alpha\mu},\\
0 & =g_{\lambda\beta,\alpha}-\Gamma_{\alpha\lambda}^{\mu}g_{\beta\mu}-\Gamma_{\beta\alpha}^{\mu}g_{\lambda\mu}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Adding the above two equations and subtracting the initial one, we obtain

\end_inset

It is easy to check that this formula defines a tensor (despite 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{\alpha\beta}^{\lambda}$

\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
R_{\lambda\rho\sigma}^{\kappa}u^{\sigma}=\nabla_{\rho}\nabla_{\lambda}u^{\kappa}-\nabla_{\lambda}\nabla_{\rho}u^{\kappa},\label{eq:Riemann nabla nabla 1}\end{equation}

 In flat space,

Suppose such a smooth map exists and maps the north pole 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,0,1\right\} $
\end_inset

 into a point 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}\in\mathbb{R}^{2}$
\end_inset

 Consider a very small circle around the north pole.
 Since the chart provides a smooth one-to-one map, this circle will be mapped
 into a small

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 circle around 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{2}$

 The circle around the north pole can be smoothly contracted into a point
 in two essentially different ways: either by contracting it to the north
 pole, or by shifting it around the sphere towards the south pole and contractin
g to the south pole, without ever crossing the north pole.
 These deformations of the circle are, by assumption, smoothly mapped into
 corresponding deformations of the image circle in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 During the second deformation, the image circle around 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{2}$
\end_inset

 is supposedly contracted into a point without ever crossing 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$
\end_inset

 But such a deformation is obviously impossible within 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{2}$

 This contradicts the assumption that a smooth one-to-one map 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{2}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{2}$

 exists.

A smooth function can be approximated arbitrarily precisely by a polynomial,
 and it is technically convenient to assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is a polynomial,
\begin_inset Formula \[
f(z)=\sum_{m=0}^{m_{\max}}\frac{1}{m!}z^{m}\left.\frac{d^{(m)}f}{dz^{m}}\right|_{z=0}.\]

\end_inset

Since derivations are linear maps by Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:linearity}

\end_inset

), it is sufficient to prove the statement for 
\begin_inset Formula $f(z)=z^{m}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $m=0,1,2,..$
\end_inset

.
 By Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:derivative of const}

\end_inset

), we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\circ1=0$
\end_inset

.
 It is trivial to check the statement for 
\begin_inset Formula $f(z)=z$
\end_inset

.
 Now use induction in 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

, starting with 
\begin_inset Formula $m=1$
\end_inset

, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
with 
\begin_inset Formula $f(z)=z$
\end_inset

.
 Once the statement is proved for 
\begin_inset Formula $f(z)=z^{m-1}$
\end_inset

, we have
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{v}\circ\left(g^{m-1}\right)=\left(m-1\right)g^{m-2}\mathbf{v}\circ g.\]

\end_inset

Now we consider 
\begin_inset Formula $f(z)=z^{m}$
\end_inset

 and use Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Leibnitz rule}

\end_inset

),
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\mathbf{v}\circ f(g) & =\mathbf{v}\circ\left(gg^{m-1}\right)=\left(\mathbf{v}\circ g\right)g^{m-1}+g\mathbf{v}\circ(g^{m-1})\\

 thus the statement is proved for

 By definition of a tangent vector and its orbits, we have 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left.\left(\mathbf{a}\circ f\right)\right|_{p_{0}}=\lim_{\delta\tau\rightarrow0}\frac{f(p_{1})-f(p_{0})}{\delta\tau},\label{eq:a circ f 1}\end{equation}

\end_inset

because the point 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}$
\end_inset

 is obtained by following the orbit of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 for an interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\tau$
\end_inset

, while the right-hand side of Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:a circ f 1}

\end_inset

) is the definition of the directional derivative along the orbit.
 The relation\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:a circ f 1}

\end_inset

) holds for every function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

, so let us apply it to the function 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}\circ f$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left.\left(\mathbf{a}\circ\left(\mathbf{b}\circ f\right)\right)\right|_{p_{0}}=\lim_{\delta\tau\rightarrow0}\frac{1}{\delta\tau}\left(\mathbf{b}\circ f(p_{1})-\mathbf{b}\circ f(p_{0})\right).\label{eq:a circ b circ f 1}\end{equation}

\end_inset

We now need to express the function 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}\circ f$
\end_inset

 similarly,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\left.\left(\mathbf{b}\circ f\right)\right|_{p_{1}} & =\lim_{\delta\tau'\rightarrow0}\frac{f(p)-f(p_{1})}{\delta\tau'},\\
\left.\left(\mathbf{b}\circ f\right)\right|_{p_{0}} & =\lim_{\delta\tau'\rightarrow0}\frac{f(p_{2})-f(p_{0})}{\delta\tau'},\end{align*}

\end_inset

where we introduced a different variable 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\tau'$
\end_inset

 for convenience.
 Substituting this into Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:a circ b circ f 1}

\end_inset

), we find
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left.\left(\mathbf{a}\circ\left(\mathbf{b}\circ f\right)\right)\right|_{p_{0}}=\lim_{\begin{array}{c}
\delta\tau\rightarrow0\\
\delta\tau'\rightarrow0\end{array}}\frac{f(p)-f(p_{1})-f(p_{2})+f(p_{0})}{\delta\tau\,\delta\tau'}.\]

\end_inset

Similarly, using the analogous relation
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left.\left(\mathbf{a}\circ f\right)\right|_{p_{2}}=\lim_{\delta\tau\rightarrow0}\frac{f(p')-f(p_{2})}{\delta\tau},\]

\end_inset

we find 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left.\left(\mathbf{b}\circ\left(\mathbf{a}\circ f\right)\right)\right|_{p_{0}}=\lim_{\begin{array}{c}
\delta\tau\rightarrow0\\
\delta\tau'\rightarrow0\end{array}}\frac{f(p')-f(p_{2})-f(p_{1})+f(p_{0})}{\delta\tau\,\delta\tau'}.\]

\end_inset

It follows that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left.\left(\left[\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\right]\circ f\right)\right|_{p_{0}}=\lim_{\begin{array}{c}
\delta\tau\rightarrow0\\
\delta\tau'\rightarrow0\end{array}}\frac{f(p)-f(p')}{\delta\tau\,\delta\tau'},\]

We may complete the vector

\end_inset

 at the initial point 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 Then the relation 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathbf{v},\mathbf{c}_{j}\right]=0$
\end_inset

 is a first-order differential equation for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}_{j}$
\end_inset

 that has a unique solution 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}_{j}(p)$
\end_inset

 along one orbit of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 starting from the initial point 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$
\end_inset

, at least in some neighborhood of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 To see this explicitly, consider the equation 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathbf{c},\mathbf{v}\right]=0$
\end_inset

 in a local coordinate system, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{\alpha}c^{\alpha}\frac{\partial v^{\beta}}{\partial x^{\alpha}}-\sum_{\alpha}v^{\alpha}\frac{\partial c^{\beta}}{\partial x^{\alpha}}=0.\]

\end_inset

Consider one orbit 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)$

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

, such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\equiv\dot{\boldsymbol{\gamma}}$
\end_inset

 is the tangent vector to the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)$
\end_inset

.
 For points 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 on the curve 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

, the second term above is equal to the derivative of the component 
\begin_inset Formula $c^{\beta}$
\end_inset

 along this orbit,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left.\sum_{\alpha}v^{\alpha}\frac{\partial c^{\beta}}{\partial x^{\alpha}}\right|_{p}=\frac{d}{d\tau}c^{\beta}(\tau),\]

\end_inset

assuming that 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)=p$
\end_inset

.
 So the equation 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathbf{c},\mathbf{v}\right]=0$
\end_inset

 at point 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 becomes
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{d}{d\tau}c^{\beta}=\sum_{\alpha}c^{\alpha}\frac{\partial v^{\beta}}{\partial x^{\alpha}},\]

\end_inset

which is an ordinary differential equation for the unknown components 
\begin_inset Formula $c^{\beta}(\tau)$
\end_inset

, to be solved with an initial condition 
\begin_inset Formula $c^{\beta}(\tau_{0})$
\end_inset

.
 This differential equation has a unique solution (by assumption, the vector
 field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is smooth everywhere).
 Thus we can in principle compute the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}_{j}(p)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is any point along one orbit of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 The set of vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}(p),\mathbf{c}_{1}(p),...,\mathbf{c}_{n-1}(p)\right\} $
\end_inset

 is linearly independent at the initial point 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$
\end_inset

 and will remain linearly independent along the orbit at least in some neighborh
ood of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 We can prove this by noting that linear independence of the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v},\mathbf{c}_{1},...,\mathbf{c}_{n-1}\right\} $
\end_inset

 can be verified by computing the determinant of their components in a local
 coordinate system.
 The vectors form a basis iff the determinant is nonzero.
 By assumption, the determinant is nonzero at 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$
\end_inset

, and the determinant is a smooth function along the orbit.
 Thus the determinant remains nonzero along the orbit at least in some neighborh
ood of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{0}$
\end_inset

 (perhaps in a very small neighborhood, but that is all we need presently).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So far we obtained a basis of connecting vectors along one orbit of

 It will follow that any two

\begin_layout Standard
First we show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{a}_{n}=0$
\end_inset

 if the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{a}_{1},...,\mathbf{a}_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is linearly dependent.
 This follows from the antisymmetry of the exterior product: suppose
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{a}_{n}=\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}\lambda_{j}\mathbf{a}_{j},\]

\end_inset

where some 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{j}$
\end_inset

 Since
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{a}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{a}_{n-1}\wedge\mathbf{a}_{j}=0\quad\textrm{for}\, j=1,...,n-1,\]

\end_inset

we have
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{a}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{a}_{n}=\mathbf{a}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{a}_{n-1}\wedge\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}\lambda_{j}\mathbf{a}_{j}=0.\]

\end_inset

Now suppose that the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{a}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is linearly independent.
 Then every basis vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{k}$
\end_inset

 can be expressed as a linear combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{a}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 with some coefficients,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{e}_{k}=\sum_{j}A_{kj}\mathbf{a}_{j}.\]

\end_inset

Let us now substitute these linear combinations into the nonzero multivector
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{n}$
\end_inset

, and simplify the resulting expression using the linearity of 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge$
\end_inset

.
 The result will be a sum of terms of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}_{j_{1}}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{a}_{j_{n}}$
\end_inset

 with some coefficients.
 Only the terms with all different 
\begin_inset Formula $j_{k}$

 Finally, we can reorder the vectors

\end_inset

 at will (and if necessary change the sign of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{a}_{n}$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{a}_{n}$
\end_inset

 with a nonzero coefficient.
 Therefore, the multivectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{a}_{n}$

\begin_inset Formula \[

\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{b}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 The transformation will be performed through a sequence of steps which
 preserve the relationship between the volume of the parallelepiped and
 the multivector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{a}_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Each step will either multiply both the volume and the multivector by the
 same number, or leave them both unchanged.
 At the end, the multivector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{a}_{n}$
\end_inset

 will be transformed into 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{b}_{n}$
\end_inset

; hence, the volumes are related by the factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The allowed steps of the transformation are of three kinds: (i) adding a

\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{a}_{i}\rightarrow\mathbf{a}_{i}+\alpha\mathbf{a}_{j},\]

\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{a}_{i}\rightarrow\alpha\mathbf{a}_{i},\]

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\neq0$
\end_inset

; (iii) exchanging two vectors, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}_{i}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}_{j}$
\end_inset

 It is clear that the multivector 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{a}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{a}_{n}\]

\end_inset

 remains unchanged under (i), is multiplied by 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 under (ii), and changes sign under (iii).
 Similarly, it is easy to see that the volume of the parallelepiped spanned
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{a}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 remains unchanged under (i) due to the argument of Fig.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Area-of-the-parallelogram}

\end_inset

, applied to the two-dimensional plane containing the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{a}_{i},\mathbf{a}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 The volume is multiplied by 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 under (ii) and changes sign under (iii).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By assumption, the initial set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{a}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is linearly independent (otherwise the volume is zero); thus, every vector
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{b}_{k}\right\} $
\end_inset

 can be expressed through linear combinations of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{a}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 These linear combinations can be built by a finite sequence of steps (i),
 (ii), or (iii).
 In this way, the multivector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{a}_{n}$
\end_inset

 can be transformed into 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{b}_{n}$

 We would like to show that 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\hat{T}\mathbf{u}_{1}\wedge\hat{T}\mathbf{u}_{2}=\left(\mathbf{u}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{u}_{2}\right)\det\hat{T}\label{eq:u relationship}\end{equation}

\end_inset

for any vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{1},\mathbf{u}_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{1},\mathbf{v}_{2}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a basis, we can decompose 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{u}_{1}=U_{11}\mathbf{v}_{1}+U_{12}\mathbf{v}_{2},\quad\mathbf{u}_{2}=U_{21}\mathbf{v}_{1}+U_{22}\mathbf{v}_{2}.\]

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{T}$
\end_inset

 is a linear map, we also have a similar decomposition
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{T}\mathbf{u}_{1}=U_{11}\hat{T}\mathbf{v}_{1}+U_{12}\hat{T}\mathbf{v}_{2},\quad\hat{T}\mathbf{u}_{2}=U_{21}\hat{T}\mathbf{v}_{1}+U_{22}\hat{T}\mathbf{v}_{2}.\]

\end_inset

Then we compute
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\mathbf{u}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{u}_{2} & =\left(U_{11}\mathbf{v}_{1}+U_{12}\mathbf{v}_{2}\right)\wedge\left(U_{21}\mathbf{v}_{1}+U_{22}\mathbf{v}_{2}\right)\\
 & =\left(U_{11}U_{22}-U_{12}U_{21}\right)\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2},\\
\hat{T}\mathbf{u}_{1}\wedge\hat{T}\mathbf{u}_{2} & =\left(U_{11}\hat{T}\mathbf{v}_{1}+U_{12}\hat{T}\mathbf{v}_{2}\right)\wedge\left(U_{21}\hat{T}\mathbf{v}_{1}+U_{22}\hat{T}\mathbf{v}_{2}\right)\\
 & =\left(U_{11}U_{22}-U_{12}U_{21}\right)\hat{T}\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\hat{T}\mathbf{v}_{2}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Therefore, the relationship\InsetSpace ~

(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:v relationship}

, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a basis.
 We need to show that 
\begin_inset Formula \[

for any other 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{u}_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Since every 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{j}$
\end_inset

 can be expressed as a linear combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{u}_{j}=\sum_{k}U_{jk}\mathbf{v}_{k},\]

\end_inset

 we may substitute these linear combinations into 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{u}_{n}$
\end_inset

 and also into 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{T}\mathbf{u}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\hat{T}\mathbf{u}_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{T}$
\end_inset

 is a linear map, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{T}\mathbf{u}_{j}=\sum_{k}U_{jk}\hat{T}\mathbf{v}_{k},\]

\end_inset

so the substitution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{T}\mathbf{u}_{j}=\sum_{k}U_{jk}\hat{T}\mathbf{v}_{k}$
\end_inset

 into 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{T}\mathbf{u}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\hat{T}\mathbf{u}_{n}$
\end_inset

 yields terms 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{T}\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\hat{T}\mathbf{v}_{n}\]

\end_inset

with the same coefficients as the substitution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{j}=\sum_{k}U_{jk}\mathbf{v}_{k}$
\end_inset

 into 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{u}_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore the desired relationship for 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{u}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 follows.

 It is convenient to consider the fully covariant Riemann tensor,
\begin_inset Formula \[

\end_inset

Since the derivatives of the arbitrary vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c},\mathbf{d}$
\end_inset

 will eventually cancel, we can simplify the calculations if we assume that
 all these derivatives vanish, so 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{b}=0$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\right]=0$
\end_inset

, etc., at a point

\end_inset

 where we are computing the Riemann tensor.
 (But note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\nabla}_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{b}\neq0$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\right]=0$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}

We would like to transform the expression 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{R}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c},\mathbf{d})$
\end_inset

 to something containing 
\begin_inset Formula $R(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c},\mathbf{d})$
\end_inset

 plus extra terms.
 It is clear that we need to express 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\nabla}$
\end_inset

 everywhere through 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla$
\end_inset

.
 We may work as follows.
 The only way to express 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\nabla}$
\end_inset

 through 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla$
\end_inset

 is by enclosing them in the metric 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{g}$
\end_inset

 and using Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:nabla after conformal}

 The difference between the connections 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\nabla}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla$

 is a transformation-valued 1-form 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\Gamma}$
\end_inset

, which is expressed as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\hat{\Gamma}(\mathbf{a})\mathbf{b} & \equiv\tilde{\nabla}_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{b}-\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{b},\\
g(\hat{\Gamma}(\mathbf{a})\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c}) & =\left(\mathbf{a}\circ\lambda\right)g(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c})+\left(\mathbf{b}\circ\lambda\right)g(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{c})\\
 & \quad-\left(\mathbf{c}\circ\lambda\right)g(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}).\end{align*}

\end_inset

 We would like to write 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\Gamma}$
\end_inset

 more explicitly, without enclosing it in 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

.
 To this end, we introduce an auxiliary (but fixed) vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{l}\equiv\hat{g}^{-1}\textrm{d}\lambda$
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\circ\lambda\equiv g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{l})$
\end_inset

 for every vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

.
 Using the field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{l}$
\end_inset

, we can rewrite 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\Gamma}$
\end_inset

 more concisely,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{\Gamma}(\mathbf{a})\mathbf{b}=g(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{l})\mathbf{b}+g(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{l})\mathbf{a}-g(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})\mathbf{l}.\]

\end_inset

Now we consider the first term in the new Riemann tensor,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\tilde{\nabla}_{\mathbf{a}}\tilde{\nabla}_{\mathbf{b}}\mathbf{c} & =\left(\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}+\hat{\Gamma}(\mathbf{a})\right)\left(\nabla_{\mathbf{b}}+\hat{\Gamma}(\mathbf{b})\right)\mathbf{c}\\
 & =\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\nabla_{\mathbf{b}}\mathbf{c}+\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\hat{\Gamma}(\mathbf{b})\mathbf{c}+\hat{\Gamma}(\mathbf{a})\hat{\Gamma}(\mathbf{b})\mathbf{c},\end{align*}

\end_inset

where we omitted terms containing first derivatives of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

, since by assumption these derivatives vanish.
 The derivative 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\hat{\Gamma}$
\end_inset

 can be computed as follows,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\hat{\Gamma}(\mathbf{b})\mathbf{c}=g(\mathbf{b},\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{l})\mathbf{c}+g(\mathbf{c},\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{l})\mathbf{b}-g(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c})\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{l},\]

\end_inset

again omitting first derivatives of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

.
 Finally, we simplify the last term,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\hat{\Gamma}(\mathbf{a}) & \hat{\Gamma}(\mathbf{b})\mathbf{c}=g(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{l})\hat{\Gamma}(\mathbf{b})\mathbf{c}+g(\hat{\Gamma}(\mathbf{b})\mathbf{c},\mathbf{l})\mathbf{a}-g(\mathbf{a},\hat{\Gamma}(\mathbf{b})\mathbf{c})\mathbf{l}\\
 & =g(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{l})\left(g(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{l})\mathbf{c}+g(\mathbf{c},\mathbf{l})\mathbf{b}-g(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c})\mathbf{l}\right)\\
 & \quad+\left(g(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{l})g(\mathbf{c},\mathbf{l})+g(\mathbf{c},\mathbf{l})g(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{l})-g(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c})g(\mathbf{l},\mathbf{l})\right)\mathbf{a}\\
 & \quad-\left(g(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{l})g(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{c})+g(\mathbf{c},\mathbf{l})g(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})-g(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c})g(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{l})\right)\mathbf{l}\\
 & =\left(2g(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{l})g(\mathbf{c},\mathbf{l})-g(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c})g(\mathbf{l},\mathbf{l})\right)\mathbf{a}+g(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{l})g(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{l})\mathbf{c}\\
 & \quad+g(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{l})g(\mathbf{c},\mathbf{l})\mathbf{b}-\left(g(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{l})g(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{c})+g(\mathbf{c},\mathbf{l})g(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})\right)\mathbf{l}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Now we need to antisymmetrize the resulting expression for 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\nabla}_{\mathbf{a}}\tilde{\nabla}_{\mathbf{b}}\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

.
 Note that
\begin_inset Formula \[
g(\mathbf{b},\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{l})=\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}g(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{l})=\mathbf{a}\circ\left(\mathbf{b}\circ\lambda\right),\]

\end_inset

and also 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\right]=0$
\end_inset

 by assumption, therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{b},\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{l})$
\end_inset

 is a symmetric bilinear form in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

.
 This bilinear form is called the 
\series bold

\series default
 of the function 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

; it is a tensor representing all the (covariant) second derivatives of
 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

.
 Let us denote this tensor by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
H_{\lambda}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})=H_{\mathbf{\lambda}}(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{a})\equiv g(\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{l},\mathbf{b});\]

\end_inset

in the index notation this would be 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{;\alpha\beta}$
\end_inset

.
 Then
\begin_inset Formula \[
\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\hat{\Gamma}(\mathbf{b})\mathbf{c}=H_{\lambda}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})\mathbf{c}+H_{\lambda}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{c})\mathbf{b}-g(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c})\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{l},\]

\end_inset

so the antisymmetrization of 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\hat{\Gamma}(\mathbf{b})\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 cancels 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{\lambda}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})$
\end_inset

 and yields
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\hat{\Gamma}(\mathbf{b})\mathbf{c}-\nabla_{\mathbf{b}}\hat{\Gamma}(\mathbf{a})\mathbf{c} & =H_{\lambda}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{c})\mathbf{b}-g(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c})\nabla_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{l}\\
 & \quad-H_{\lambda}(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c})\mathbf{a}+g(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{c})\nabla_{\mathbf{b}}\mathbf{l}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

The antisymmetrization of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\Gamma}(\mathbf{a})\hat{\Gamma}(\mathbf{b})\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 gives (after some cancellations)
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\hat{\Gamma}(\mathbf{a}) & \hat{\Gamma}(\mathbf{b})\mathbf{c}-\hat{\Gamma}(\mathbf{b})\hat{\Gamma}(\mathbf{a})\mathbf{c}=g(\mathbf{l},\mathbf{l})\left(g(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{c})\mathbf{b}-g(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c})\mathbf{a}\right)\\
 & +g(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{l})\left(g(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c})\mathbf{l}-g(\mathbf{c},\mathbf{l})\mathbf{b}\right)+g(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{l})\left(g(\mathbf{c},\mathbf{l})\mathbf{a}-g(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{c})\mathbf{l}\right).\end{align*}

\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{Tr}$

, so the new Ricci tensor is 
\begin_inset Formula $e^{-2\lambda}$
\end_inset

 times the trace 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{Tr}$
\end_inset

 of the new Riemann tensor.
 In this way we derive the required expressions for

 First we use Eq.\InsetSpace ~

We would like to lift the restrictions on the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 For a fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

, the function 
\begin_inset Formula $R(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{v},\mathbf{y})$
\end_inset

 is a symmetric bilinear form of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

.
 This bilinear form can be determined for spacelike 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 by a finite number of values (say, with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 being vectors of a spacelike basis).
 The requirement that vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 be spacelike and orthogonal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is then easily lifted since 
\begin_inset Formula $R(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{x},...)$
\end_inset

 is linear and antisymmetric in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v},\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 and hence
\begin_inset Formula \[
R(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{v},\mathbf{y})=R(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{x}+\lambda\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v},\mathbf{y}+\mu\mathbf{v})\]

\end_inset

for any 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda,\mu$
\end_inset

 Thus we can deduce 
\begin_inset Formula $R(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{v},\mathbf{y})$
\end_inset

 for arbitrary 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

.
 Subsequently, we can regard 
\begin_inset Formula $R(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{v},\mathbf{y})$
\end_inset

 for fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 as a quadratic form 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
Q_{\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}}(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})\equiv R(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{v},\mathbf{y}).\label{eq:Q x y def}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 A standard trick in linear algebra is to recover a symmetric bilinear form
 
\begin_inset Formula $A(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})$
\end_inset

 if the quadratic form 
\begin_inset Formula $A(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})$
\end_inset

 is known:
\begin_inset Formula \[
A(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})=\frac{A(\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b},\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b})-A(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{a})-A(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{b})}{2}.\]

\end_inset

Therefore, we can try to recover a symmetric bilinear form 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})$
\end_inset

 from the quadratic form 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}}(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})$
\end_inset

 as follows,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
Q_{\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})\equiv & \frac{1}{2}\left(R(\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b},\mathbf{y})\right.\nonumber \\
 & \left.-R(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{a},\mathbf{y})-R(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{y})\right).\label{eq:finding Q x y a b}\end{align}

\end_inset

To recover 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})$
\end_inset

 completely, it suffices to know the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})$
\end_inset

 for arbitrary basis vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

; in total, we need 10 different values (for fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

).
 However, we are allowed to measure only 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}}(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})$
\end_inset

 for future-directed and timelike 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
 We note that the sum of two such vectors, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}+\mathbf{v}_{2}$
\end_inset

, is again future-directed and timelike.
 So we may deduce 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})$
\end_inset

 for any two future-directed, timelike 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 using Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:finding Q x y a b}

\end_inset

).
 We also note that a basis in the four-dimensional space can be found as
 a linearly independent set of 4 future-directed, timelike vectors.
 Such a basis will not be orthogonal, but one does not need an orthogonal
 basis to determine a bilinear form.
 Hence, for fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 the bilinear form 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})$
\end_inset

 can be determined by finitely many measurements.
 This process needs to be repeated for 10 different combinations of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

.
 We are thus able to deduce the values 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})$
\end_inset

 for 
\emph on
arbitrary
\emph default
 vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 if we measure 
\begin_inset Formula $R(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{v},\mathbf{y})$
\end_inset

 for sufficiently many future-directed timelike vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 and spacelike vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 (each time orthogonal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

).

\begin_layout Standard
So far we recovered the bilinear form 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})$
\end_inset

, which is symmetric in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 and also in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

.
 Despite the suggestive Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Q x y def}

\end_inset

), we must note that 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})\neq R(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{y})$
\end_inset

.
 Consider 
\begin_inset Formula $R(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{y})$
\end_inset

 for fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 as a bilinear form of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

.
 This bilinear form is not necessarily symmetric in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

.
 In general, this bilinear form has a symmetric part,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{1}{2}\left(R(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{y})+R(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{a},\mathbf{y})\right),\]

\end_inset

and an antisymmetric part, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{1}{2}\left(R(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{y})-R(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{a},\mathbf{y})\right).\]

\end_inset

 The quadratic form 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}}(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})$
\end_inset

 is defined through Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Q x y def}

\end_inset

) and knows only about the symmetric part of 
\begin_inset Formula $R(...)$
\end_inset

 as shown above.
 Therefore, we recover precisely the symmetric part of 
\begin_inset Formula $R(...)$
\end_inset

 when we determine the bilinear form 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})$
\end_inset

 is related to 
\begin_inset Formula $R(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{y})$
\end_inset

 through symmetrization in 
\begin_inset Formula $(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
Q_{\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})=\frac{1}{2}\left(R(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{y})+R(\mathbf{b},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{a},\mathbf{y})\right).\label{eq:Qxy Raxby}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 To recover the full Riemann tensor, it remains to extract the antisymmetric
 part.
 A property of 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 not yet used is the first Bianchi identity\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Bianchi 1}

\end_inset

), which we apply to the last term in Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Qxy Raxby}

\end_inset

) and obtain
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
2Q_{\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}) & =R(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{y})-R(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{y})-R(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\\
 & =-2R(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y},\mathbf{b})+R(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{y},\mathbf{x}).\end{align*}

\end_inset

We now need to express this somehow through 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

.
 Note that a suitable combination is
\begin_inset Formula \[
2Q_{\mathbf{b},\mathbf{x}}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{y})=R(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{y},\mathbf{x})+R(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y},\mathbf{b}).\]

\end_inset

Hence
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
2Q_{\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}) & =-3R(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y},\mathbf{b})+2Q_{\mathbf{b},\mathbf{x}}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{y});\\
R(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{y}) & =\frac{2}{3}\left(Q_{\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})-Q_{\mathbf{b},\mathbf{x}}(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{y})\right).\end{align*}

\end_inset

Thus all the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $R(...)$
\end_inset

 can be deduced from the given experimental data.

Suppose that the vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 is the 4-velocity of the stationary observers, so
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{u}=\partial_{t}=\frac{1}{z}\mathbf{k},\quad z=e^{Ht}.\]

\end_inset

Denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 the 4-velocity of the particle.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula \[
g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})=g(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{u})=1.\]

\end_inset

 The relative 3-velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\vec{v}$
\end_inset

 is related to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

relativistic gamma-factor
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 by
\begin_inset Formula \[
\gamma=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\left(\delta\vec{v}\right)^{2}}}\geq1;\]

\end_inset

on the other hand, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=g(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, we need to compute the change of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

gamma-factor
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 along the worldline of the particle.
 We first note that for arbitrary 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 the property
\begin_inset Formula \[
g(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{k},\mathbf{y})+g(\nabla_{\mathbf{y}}\mathbf{k},\mathbf{x})=\left(\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{k}}g\right)\circ\left(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\right)=2He^{Ht}g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\]

\end_inset

holds.
 Thus, assuming 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{v}=0$
\end_inset

, we have
\begin_inset Formula \[
\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}g(\mathbf{k},\mathbf{v})=g(\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{k},\mathbf{v})=He^{Ht}g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})=He^{Ht}.\]

\end_inset

 However, we need to compute 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}g(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})$
\end_inset

, while 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})$
\end_inset

 differs from 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\mathbf{k},\mathbf{v})$
\end_inset

 by a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 only.
 So we need to compute the derivative 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}t\equiv\mathbf{v}\circ t=g(\mathbf{v},\partial_{t})=g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{u})\equiv\gamma.\]

\end_inset

 Then we can write
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\gamma & =\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}g(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})=\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\left[e^{-Ht}g(\mathbf{k},\mathbf{v})\right]\\
 & =\left(\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}e^{-Ht}\right)e^{Ht}\gamma+e^{-Ht}He^{Ht}\\
 & =\left(1-\gamma^{2}\right)H.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 the proper time parameter along the worldline of the particle.
 Then we obtain the differential equation
\begin_inset Formula \[
\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\gamma=\frac{d\gamma}{d\tau}=\left(1-\gamma^{2}\right)H.\]

\end_inset

The general solution, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)=\coth H(\tau-\tau_{0})$
\end_inset

, exponentially approaches 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=1$
\end_inset

 at late times.
 In the Newtonian limit, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\gamma\approx1-\frac{1}{2}\left(\delta\vec{v}\right)^{2},\]

\end_inset

the equation for 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma(\tau)$
\end_inset

 becomes
\begin_inset Formula \[
\delta\vec{v}\cdot\frac{d}{d\tau}\delta\vec{v}=-H\left(\delta\vec{v}\right)^{2}.\]

\end_inset

It is easy to see that a geodesic is a straight line in the three-dimensional
 space.
 Thus the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

force of friction
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 acting on the particle is directed opposite to the velocity 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\vec{v}$
\end_inset

.
 Then, in the framework of Newton's second law, the force vector can be
 expressed as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\vec{F}=m\frac{d}{d\tau}\delta\vec{v}=-H\delta\vec{v}.\]

 & =\frac{g(\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{k},\mathbf{v})-g(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}z}{z}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $z\equiv\sqrt{g(\mathbf{k},\mathbf{k})}$

\begin_inset Formula \[
\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}z=\frac{1}{2z}\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}g(\mathbf{k},\mathbf{k})=\frac{1}{z}g(\nabla_{\mathbf{v}}\mathbf{k},\mathbf{k}).\]

\end_inset

So it remains to compute the bilinear form 
\begin_inset Formula $g(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{k},\mathbf{y})$
\end_inset

.
 If the vector field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{k}$
\end_inset

 is integrable then 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{g}\mathbf{k}$
\end_inset

 is an exact 1-form and the first term the Koszul formula,
\begin_inset Formula \[

\end_inset

cancels (here 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}$

 are arbitrary vectors).
 For an integrable conformal Killing vector

\begin_inset Formula \[
g(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\mathbf{k},\mathbf{y})=\frac{1}{2}\left(\mathcal{L}_{\mathbf{k}}g\right)\circ\left(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\right)=\lambda g(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}).\]

\end_inset

Using this property, we compute
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\frac{d\gamma}{d\tau} & =\frac{\lambda g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{v})-\gamma z^{-1}\lambda g(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{k})}{z}\\

 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{\mathbf{u}}\mathbf{u}$

 This means that the orbits of

\end_inset

 is also a permutation of the same kind.
 It follows that a nonzero contribution is possible only if the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ k_{1},...,k_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a permutation of the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \sigma(1),...,\sigma(n)\right\} $
\end_inset

 The expression for 
\begin_inset Formula $*(\omega_{1}\wedge*\omega_{2})$
\end_inset

 contains a sum over the indices 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{1}$
\end_inset

, ..., 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{n}$
\end_inset

 as well as a sum over all permutations 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
 & *(\omega_{1}\wedge*\omega_{2})=\left(\det\eta_{ab}\right)\sum_{\sigma}\sum_{k_{1},...,k_{n}}\frac{\eta^{k_{1}k_{1}}...\eta^{k_{n}k_{n}}}{n!}\omega_{2}(\mathbf{e}_{k_{1}},...,\mathbf{e}_{k_{n}})\nonumber \\
 & \quad\times\frac{\left(-1\right)^{\left|\sigma\right|}}{n!\left(N-n\right)!}\omega_{1}(\mathbf{e}_{\sigma(1)},...,\mathbf{e}_{\sigma(n)})\nonumber \\
 & \quad\times\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\mathbf{e}_{k_{1}},...,\mathbf{e}_{k_{n}},\mathbf{e}_{\sigma(n+1)},...,\mathbf{e}_{\sigma(N)}).\label{eq:wedge permutation 2}\end{align}

\end_inset

 For a given permutation 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

, there are 
\begin_inset Formula $n!$
\end_inset

 sets 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ k_{1},...,k_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 that give a nonzero contribution because they are permutations of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \sigma(1),...,\sigma(n)\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 The contributions of these 
\begin_inset Formula $n!$
\end_inset

 sets to Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:wedge permutation 2}

\end_inset

) are all equal, hence the sum over 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ k_{1},...,k_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 can be replaced by an extra factor 
\begin_inset Formula $n!$
\end_inset

, while the indices 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{1}$
\end_inset

, ..., 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{n}$
\end_inset

 may be relabeled as 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(1)$
\end_inset

, ..., 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(n)$
\end_inset

.
 So we find
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
 & *(\omega_{1}\wedge*\omega_{2})=\left(\det\eta_{ab}\right)\sum_{\sigma}\frac{\left(-1\right)^{\left|\sigma\right|}}{n!\left(N-n\right)!}\eta^{\sigma(1)\sigma(1)}...\eta^{\sigma(n)\sigma(n)}\\
 & \quad\times\omega_{2}(\mathbf{e}_{\sigma(1)},...,\mathbf{e}_{\sigma(n)})\omega_{1}(\mathbf{e}_{\sigma(1)},...,\mathbf{e}_{\sigma(n)})\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\mathbf{e}_{\sigma(1)},...,\mathbf{e}_{\sigma(N)}).\end{align*}

\end_inset

The expression above is manifestly symmetric under the exchange 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{1}\leftrightarrow\omega_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 This already proves the first part of the statement 
\series bold
(a)
\series default
, but it is useful to derive a simplified form of the expression 
\begin_inset Formula $*(\omega_{1}\wedge*\omega_{2})$
\end_inset

.
 We note that
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(-1\right)^{\left|\sigma\right|}\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}(\mathbf{e}_{\sigma(1)},...,\mathbf{e}_{\sigma(N)})=1\]

\end_inset

for any permutation 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

, and hence
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
 & *(\omega_{1}\wedge*\omega_{2})=\left(\det\eta_{ab}\right)\sum_{\sigma}\frac{\eta^{\sigma(1)\sigma(1)}...\eta^{\sigma(n)\sigma(n)}}{n!\left(N-n\right)!}\\
 & \quad\times\omega_{2}(\mathbf{e}_{\sigma(1)},...,\mathbf{e}_{\sigma(n)})\omega_{1}(\mathbf{e}_{\sigma(1)},...,\mathbf{e}_{\sigma(n)}).\end{align*}

\end_inset

 Since the expression above is independent of the permutation elements 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \sigma(n+1),...,\sigma(N)\right\} $
\end_inset

, we may sum over them, introducing an extra factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(N-n\right)!$
\end_inset

.
 Finally, we relabel the indices 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(1)$
\end_inset

, ..., 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(n)$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{1}$
\end_inset

, ..., 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{n}$
\end_inset

 and obtain the formula
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
*(\omega_{1}\wedge*\omega_{2}) & =\frac{\left(\det\eta_{ab}\right)}{n!}\sum_{k_{1},...,k_{n}}\eta^{k_{1}k_{1}}...\eta^{k_{n}k_{n}}\nonumber \\
 & \quad\times\omega_{1}(\mathbf{e}_{k_{1}},...,\mathbf{e}_{k_{n}})\omega_{2}(\mathbf{e}_{k_{1}},...,\mathbf{e}_{k_{n}}).\label{eq:star omega wedge star omega}\end{align}

\end_inset

Using this explicit formula, it is straightforward to show that the basis
 
\begin_inset Formula $n$

-forms 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a_{1}}\wedge...\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{a_{n}}$
\end_inset

 comprise an orthonormal basis with respect to the scalar product

The formula for

 One notes that

 should be a linear combination of

 Due to the antisymmetry of

\begin_inset Formula $b$

\end_inset

 as the first index).
 Moreover, the antisymmetry of 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi_{a\, bc}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(a,b\right)$
\end_inset

 means that the only possibility is
\begin_inset Formula \[

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda,\mu$

It remains to show that this solution is unique.
 Suppose there exist two different solutions 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\chi}_{a\, b}$

\end_inset

 The difference 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}_{a\, b}\equiv\tilde{\boldsymbol{\chi}}_{a\, b}-\boldsymbol{\chi}_{a\, b}$
\end_inset

 satisfies the homogeneous equations
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{b}\mathbf{X}_{a\, b}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{b}=0,\quad\mathbf{X}_{a\, b}=-\mathbf{X}_{b\, a}.\]

\end_inset

The 1-forms 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}_{a\, b}$

\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \boldsymbol{\theta}^{c}\right\} $
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{X}_{a\, b}=\sum_{c}X_{a\, bc}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{c},\quad X_{a\, bc}=-X_{b\, ac}.\]

Then we can write
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{b}\mathbf{X}_{a\, b}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{b}=\sum_{b,c}X_{a\, bc}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{b}\wedge\boldsymbol{\theta}^{c}=0.\]

 It follows that

\begin_inset Formula $X_{a\, bc}$

 However, it is impossible that a nonzero quantity

\end_inset

 is symmetric in 
\begin_inset Formula $b,c$

 and at the same time antisymmetric in

 Namely, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
X_{a\, bc}=-X_{b\, ac}=-X_{b\, ca}=X_{c\, ba}=X_{c\, ab}=-X_{a\, cb}=-X_{a\, bc},\]

so 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{a\, bc}=0$

 for any

 Therefore, the difference between

\begin_layout Section
Comments on Ludvigsen's 
\emph on
General Relativity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The book is M.
 Ludvigsen,
\emph on
 General relativity: a geometric aproach
\emph default
 (Cambridge University Press, 1999).
 Many explanations in that book are outstandingly clear, and I benefited
 greatly by reading it.
 Nevertheless, there are some minor gaffes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1) On p.
 91, eq.\InsetSpace ~
9.27 is supposedly the same as eq.\InsetSpace ~
9.20 when 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

written in full.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 However, these equations actually differ by the choice of the permuted
 indices.
 The relation 9.27 can be obtained from 9.20 only if one assumes the identity
 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{abcd}=R_{cdab}$
\end_inset

, which Ludvigsen actually never mentions in the book.
 This well-known standard identity is a consequence of 9.19 and 9.20.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2) On p.
 103, eq.\InsetSpace ~
10.14 contains 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{a}\nabla^{a}\phi=R...$
\end_inset

, while the preceding (unnumbered) equation on p.102 contains 
\begin_inset Formula $-\nabla_{e}\nabla^{a}\phi=R...$
\end_inset

.
 A minus sign has materialized from nowhere! The answer (10.17) is correct,
 and the extra minus sign is actually needed to compensate for an error
 made earlier.
 In the last paragraph on p.
 101, Ludvigsen writes (in 3-dimensional notation) 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}=\nabla\phi$
\end_inset

 whereas in fact 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}=-\nabla\phi$
\end_inset

 in Newtonian gravity.
 (The acceleration points down, the potential grows upwards.) So the correct
 calculation starts by introducing 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{a}=\nabla_{a}\phi$
\end_inset

 and not 
\begin_inset Formula $-\nabla_{a}\phi$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3) On p.
 108, top line, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Using the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{a}n^{a}=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla_{a}l_{b}=\nabla_{b}l_{a}$
\end_inset

, we have...
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 --- actually, the same result follows with merely the assumption that 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{a}$
\end_inset

 is a null geodesic.
 It is not necessary to assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{a}$
\end_inset

 is integrable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4) On p.
 109, top line, --- one cannot actually derive Eq.
 (11.10) as claimed.
 By contracting the top equation with 
\begin_inset Formula $l^{a}m^{b}m^{c}$
\end_inset

 and using Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(11.8), which already assumes that 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 is integrable, one gets
\begin_inset Formula \[
D\sigma=R(l,m,l,m)+2l^{a}\bar{m}_{b}(\nabla_{a}m^{b}).\]

\end_inset

Now it is unclear how to show that the last term is equal to 2
\begin_inset Formula $\rho\sigma$
\end_inset

.
 There is a significant freedom in 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla m$
\end_inset

 since 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is chosen simply to be orthogonal to 
\begin_inset Formula $n,l$
\end_inset

 and this is not sufficient to fix 
\begin_inset Formula $\nabla m$
\end_inset

.
 In fact, the null tetrad can be changed by the transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $m\rightarrow e^{i\lambda}m$
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\rightarrow e^{2i\lambda}\sigma$
\end_inset

, as shown at top of page 110.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is a function of position then the equation 
\begin_inset Formula $D\sigma=...$
\end_inset

 will be changed after the transformation! Thus this equation really depends
 on the choice of the tetrad, and some choices are better than others.
 The equation (11.10) is perhaps obtained with a suitable choice of the tetrad,
 but this is not discussed in the book.

\begin_layout Section
Author's position on commercial publishing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thanks to modern technology, one can prepare an entire book electronically
 on a personal computer, in ready-to-print form.
 Sending an electronic book across the world takes at most a few minutes
 and costs about as much as a cup of tea.
 The author encourages everyone interested in reading the text to download
 and/or print it, in whole or in part.
 The two-column formatting of the text is designed to require the least
 possible amount of paper when printed.
 Everyone is also entitled to commission a print shop to produce bound copies
 of the text, in which case the single-column formatting may be preferred.
 The cost of one bound copy may be estimated as 10 to 20 US dollars.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A commercial publisher may want to offer professionally printed and bound
 copies for sale.
 Since this book is distributed with complete source, it will be a matter
 of minutes to reformat the book according to the taste or constraints of
 a particular publisher even without the author's assistance.
 The author welcomes commercial printing of the text, as long as the publisher
 adheres to the conditions of the license (the GNU FDL).
 Since the FDL disallows granting exclusive distribution rights, the author
 cannot sign a standard exclusive-rights contract with a publisher.
 However, the author will consider signing any publishing contract that
 leaves intact the conditions of the FDL.
